<p class='tac fsl'>PREFACE</p>

<p>The love of adventure is inborn in all normal boys. Action is almost a
supreme demand in the stories they read with most pleasure. Recognizing this
primary demand, in this tale I have endeavored to keep in mind this requisite
and at the same time to avoid sensational appeals. The unusual is not always the
improbable. The Go Ahead Boys are striving to be active without being unduly
precocious or preternaturally endowed.</p>

<h1>THE GO AHEAD BOYS AND THE TREASURE CAVE</h1>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='fss'>THE VOYAGE IS BEGUN</span></h2>
<p>&#8220;A-a-ll ha-a-ands! Up anchor! A-ho-oy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Instantly all was bustle and action on board the brig
<i>Josephine</i>. The sailors ran hither and thither, the sails were
loosed and the yards braced. The clanking of the windlass soon told
that the anchor was being raised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! I never saw so much excitement and hurry in all my
life,&#8221; exclaimed a boy, who with three companions stood on the
deck of the brig and looked on at these activities without actually
taking part in them themselves. The speaker was Fred Button. He was a
tiny little fellow, known affectionately among his friends as Stub, or
Peewee or Pygmy. This last name was frequently shortened into Pyg, much
to Fred&#8217;s disgust, though he had learned better than to lose his
temper because of teasing or little things that did not just suit him.
He had given up such foolishness long ago.</p>

<p>With his three companions he had embarked on the <i>Josephine</i>
for a voyage to Buenos Aires in South America. The lure of the sea had
attracted these four boys and the desire to see something of foreign
lands had spurred them on. They were on board in the capacity of
passengers though it was also their desire to help the crew in whatever
way they were able.</p>

<p>Standing beside Fred Button was John Clemens, a boy who was as
unusually tall as Fred was short. He was extremely thin, however, and
with his six feet three inches of height he looked like a string,
according to his friends. In fact that was what they usually called
him.</p>

<p>Next to him was Grant Jones. Grant was about eighteen, the same age
as the other three boys though he was their leader in a great many
ways. No matter what he attempted he always did it well. In school work
he usually led his class and on the athletic field he far outshone the
others. His talents had won him the nickname of Socrates which,
however, was usually shortened to Soc. &#8220;Old Soc Jones&#8221; was
always a favorite.</p>

<p>The fourth member of the group was George Washington Sanders. He was
always good natured and his witty remarks had made him intensely
popular with all who knew him. In honor of the name he bore he
sometimes had been referred to as the father of his country, which
appellation, however, had finally been corrupted to Pop.</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly is busy around here, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
exclaimed Grant Jones in response to Fred Button&#8217;s remarks
previously referred to.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s all mystery to me,&#8221; added John Clemens.
&#8220;These orders being shouted and the strange things the men are
doing are getting me bewildered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been standing here expecting some one of the
sailors to mistake you for a mast and hang a sail on you any minute,
String,&#8221; said Pop Sanders slyly, at the same time nudging Fred
Button.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; exclaimed John Clemens quickly. &#8220;At
any rate, I&#8217;d rather be the shape of a mast than a bag of
ballast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way, String,&#8221; said Grant Jones
encouragingly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let him get the better of
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He never has and he never will,&#8221; said John
complacently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop arguing,&#8221; exclaimed Fred Button, &#8220;and tell
me what kind of a boat this is that we are on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sailing boat,&#8221; said Pop Sanders.
&#8220;Did you think it was a steamer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean what kind of a sailing boat is it. Is it a schooner or
a bark, or what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a brig,&#8221; said Socrates Jones. &#8220;You can
always tell a brig from the way she is rigged. She has two masts and is
square rigged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought that was a brigantine,&#8221; protested Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;A brigantine is very much the
same though. She has two masts and is square rigged on the foremast,
but schooner rigged on the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is called the mainmast,&#8221; said Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; agreed Grant. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make a
sailor of you yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Josephine</i> was now sliding through the waters of New York
Bay. The Statue of Liberty was just ahead on her right (or rather her
starboard side) while on the port side was Governor&#8217;s Island,
with its old fort and parade ground plainly to be seen. Two big ocean
liners loomed up a short distance away. One was just completing her
voyage from Europe while the other was only starting. Saucy little tugs
rushed hither and thither. Ferryboats passed, bearing their precious
burdens of human freight. Great barges loaded to the water&#8217;s edge
were towed slowly along. Ahead could be seen many steamers lying at
anchor in the lower bay off the quarantine station, while now and again
a sailing vessel similar to the one on which the Go Ahead boys were
embarked could also be seen. They were not very numerous, however.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of it, boys?&#8221; demanded a bluff,
hearty voice behind them. It was Captain Roger Dodge, the commander of
the <i>Josephine</i>, who spoke to them. His face was bronzed by the
sun and wind and his drooping mustache was faded to a straw color. His
gray eyes were the features that struck any one who observed him
closely, however. A merry twinkle could be seen in them, but at the
same time their expression denoted that their owner was a man who would
never be afraid of anything on land or sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;We think it&#8217;s fine,&#8221; exclaimed Fred Button
speaking for the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonderful harbor all right,&#8221; said Captain
Dodge. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s just about the finest in the world and
I&#8217;ve seen most of them too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What one do you like next to this, captain?&#8221; inquired
Grant. Old Soc Jones was always eager to learn something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the captain slowly, &#8220;I guess the
harbor at Sydney, Australia, next to this. Still San Francisco has a
wonderful harbor, too. That golden gate out there is a sight worth
seeing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could see it,&#8221; said Grant, wistfully.
&#8220;Some day I hope to do it, too. Still, there are so many
wonderful places in the world it&#8217;s hard to say which ones
you&#8217;d rather see first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very true,&#8221; agreed the captain.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen a good many, but I always want to see more.
I&#8217;ve knocked around the world so long that I don&#8217;t believe
I could settle down and be happy now. I guess I&#8217;ve got the
wanderlust all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to get,&#8221; exclaimed Pop Sanders, serious
for once. &#8220;We&#8217;ve all got it ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long have you been a sailor, captain?&#8221; asked John
Clemens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirty years. I started in as a cabin boy when I was fourteen
years old and I&#8217;ve been at it ever since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to know about all there is to know about it, I
should think,&#8221; said Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Without boasting at all, I can safely say that I do know a
lot about the business,&#8221; said Captain Dodge, smilingly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve done about all there is to do on a ship, I
guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve had some wonderful experiences,&#8221;
suggested Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have,&#8221; said the captain smilingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you tell us about them sometime?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be glad to,&#8221; said the captain readily.
&#8220;Not now, though, for, as you can see, I am pretty busy,&#8221;
and the bluff sailor hurried away, shouting orders to his men, who all
seemed to like him and take delight in carrying out his commands as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Dodge isn&#8217;t much like the sea captains we used
to read about in the old story books, is he?&#8221; remarked Grant
Jones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; demanded Pop Sanders. &#8220;He certainly
looks like a sailor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; agreed Grant, &#8220;but I meant the kind
of a man the crew all hated and feared and who used to give them the
rope&#8217;s end every time they did anything he didn&#8217;t
like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That day has passed, I guess,&#8221; laughed John Clemens.
&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s lucky for us, too, for we might get it
ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any one would have to be a pretty good shot to hit you with
anything, String,&#8221; said Pop Sanders teasingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh,&#8221; snorted John, but he made no other reply.</p>

<p>At this moment Captain Dodge approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to anchor, boys,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
wind is dead ahead of us here in the narrows and I think I&#8217;ll
wait till it shifts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We might all go to Coney Island then,&#8221; exclaimed Fred
Button eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the wind might change almost any minute and we&#8217;d
sail off and leave you behind,&#8221; laughed Captain Dodge.
&#8220;Coney Island is just around that point, though, and you could
row there in a little while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll stay aboard if you&#8217;re thinking of
leaving us,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather go to Buenos
Aires than Coney Island.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I say,&#8221; exclaimed John Clemens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we do something to help around here?&#8221; asked
Grant. &#8220;We&#8217;re only amateur sailors, but we&#8217;re anxious
to do what we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you are,&#8221; said Captain Dodge. &#8220;I expect
you to take your regular turns on watch with the rest of the crew. Just
now I want the sails taken in, though. Do you suppose one of you could
go up that foremast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could,&#8221; cried Fred quickly. &#8220;Let me
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think you can take in that topsail?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all I want, of course. There&#8217;ll be a
sailor up there with you to tell you what to do and perhaps you can be
of assistance to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to try it, anyway,&#8221; said Fred
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the captain. &#8220;Mr.
Johnson,&#8221; he called to the first mate, who was a big
blonde-haired Swede, &#8220;this young man wants to go aloft. Will you
let him help your man take in that fore-topsail?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; came the quick reply, and Fred ran to the
foot of the mast, where Mr. Johnson, the mate, and a sailor named
Petersen were standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow me,&#8221; said Petersen, and he began to climb. Up
the rigging he went, with Fred close behind him. It was hard work for
the inexperienced boy to keep pace with the hardy sailor, and he was
well-nigh exhausted when at last they stood upon the yards.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s hard work,&#8221; panted Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get used to it,&#8221; smiled the sailor.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a knack about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do we do now?&#8221; demanded Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till we get our orders. The captain will bring &#8217;er up
into the wind in a minute and that&#8217;s when we get to
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You grab all the loose sail you can, right in your arms, and
try to hold it there. They&#8217;ll let go below.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fred felt dizzy, standing so high above the decks, and he clung to
the ropes which were all about him, for dear life. He heartily wished
that he was once more with his comrades, but it was too late now. He
must go through with it, and he was determined, if possible, not to
betray his nervousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand by!&#8221; came the faint call from below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang on now,&#8221; cautioned Petersen. &#8220;They&#8217;re
going to bring &#8217;er &#8217;round.&#8221;</p>

<p>The steersman put the helm hard over and the <i>Josephine</i> swung
rapidly around with her bow into the wind. In spite of the warning Fred
did not hold on as tightly as he should. He felt himself slipping. He
clutched madly at the maze of ropes which entirely surrounded him. He
tried to call out, but no sound came. Desperately he strove to save
himself, but his efforts were unavailing.</p>

<hr class='pb' /> <h2><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span
class='fss'>A PLUCKY FEAT</span></h2>

<p>Fred&#8217;s three companions on the deck below watched their friend
with horrified eyes. They had felt envious of his good fortune until
now, and every one of them had wished that he was in Fred&#8217;s
place.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be great up there,&#8221; Grant exclaimed as he
looked at Fred standing up against the topmast, far above the
decks.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the place to be, all right,&#8221; said String
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were up there it would look like two masts instead of
one,&#8221; said Pop Sanders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; said John in disgust. &#8220;You got off that
same joke just a few minutes ago. It was all right the first time, but
it&#8217;s a pretty poor one now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three boys had stood below bantering one another and envying
Fred until the <i>Josephine</i> came about and they saw that their
comrade was dizzy and in danger of falling.</p>

<p>He swayed dangerously for a while that seemed a century long. He
waved his arms wildly in the air and then clutched frantically for some
rope or brace to save himself. He seemed to grab hold of plenty of
ropes but to hang on to none. Moreover, a rope was the cause of his
fall, for one swung violently around and catching the unfortunate boy
around the ankles tripped him up and pulled him from the precarious
spot on which he stood.</p>

<p>He toppled backward and fell. His three companions with one accord
uttered a groan of horror and shut their eyes to keep out the awful
sight of what was about to happen. To think that their wonderful trip
was to be spoiled at the very start in this way! They turned their
backs to the scene, afraid to look. Every boy expected to hear a thud
on the deck and see the mangled body of their companion at their
feet.</p>

<p>To them it seemed as if they waited hours and yet they did not hear
the expected sound. Instead of that they heard a shout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold him!&#8221; some one cried, and opening their eyes and
daring to look about them, the three boys on the deck saw something
that was as unexpected as it was welcome.</p>

<p>Fred hung head downward from the yard, a rope twisted tightly around
his feet. The same rope that had thrown him from his position was now
holding him suspended in the air. But how securely did it hold him?
Could it support him until help could come? That was the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to him, somebody!&#8221; cried Grant in an agonized voice.
Even as he spoke a sailor ran swiftly along the deck to the base of the
foremast and began to climb rapidly. To those who watched him, however,
it seemed as if he progressed at a snail&#8217;s pace.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going to drop!&#8221; groaned String.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not,&#8221; said Pop Sanders, trying to appear
cheerful.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can he do if he does reach him?&#8221; demanded
Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait and see,&#8221; cautioned Pop.</p>

<p>Higher and higher climbed the sailor. From above Petersen, the man
who had accompanied Fred to the top, leaned down and took hold of the
rope which was all that kept the unfortunate boy from falling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t pull on that,&#8221; begged Grant.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll surely come loose.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailor had now approached within a few feet of Fred. A moment
later and he was by his side. He made no move to help the boy who hung
so perilously out into space. Instead he shouted something to Petersen
which could not be heard on the deck below.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with him?&#8221; demanded Pop
angrily. &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t he do something?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him alone,&#8221; cautioned Grant. &#8220;I guess he
knows his business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Fred&#8217;ll fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess not. That sailor can see how firm a hold that rope
has on his ankles. He won&#8217;t take any chances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He called for a rope,&#8221; exclaimed John Clemens.
&#8220;See, that sailor who went up with Fred is letting one
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s making the other one fast to the yard,&#8221;
added Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re going to haul him up, I guess,&#8221; said
Pop.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;See,
he&#8217;s tying the other end around Fred&#8217;s chest. They&#8217;ll
have him fixed all right in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he doesn&#8217;t fall before,&#8221; String reminded
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re certainly a pessimist, String,&#8221; exclaimed
Pop. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you ever have a cheerful thought?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I do, but I&#8217;m worried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I. I try to be cheerful now and then,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right now,&#8221; exclaimed Grant as the
sailor finished tying the rope around Fred&#8217;s body. &#8220;He
couldn&#8217;t fall now to save his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailor scrambled quickly up the mast until he stood alongside
Petersen. Then the two men bent low, and hauling in hand over hand,
soon pulled Fred up to the yard on which they stood. They did not untie
the rope from around his waist, however, but rather made the loose end
of it fast around the mast so that the accident could not be repeated.
A great cheer from those who had assembled below greeted the result of
this work.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess Fred&#8217;s awfully dizzy just now,&#8221; remarked
Grant. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s much fun hanging by your
heels way up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now how are they going to get him down?&#8221; demanded
Pop. &#8220;He certainly can&#8217;t do it by himself. He&#8217;d be
sure to fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment Captain Dodge joined the three boys. &#8220;A pretty
close call for our sailor friend,&#8221; he remarked grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Grant, &#8220;it certainly was. I
don&#8217;t suppose he&#8217;ll want to do much climbing for quite a
while now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; said the captain heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you going to get him down?&#8221; asked Pop.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy,&#8221; said the captain, smiling.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll take a very long rope, one that will reach all the
way from the deck up to where he is and back again. We&#8217;ll tie one
end around your friend and we&#8217;ll hang on to the other down here
on the deck. The rope will go over the yard and he will be on one end
and we will be on the other. Then we&#8217;ll lower away slowly and the
first thing you know he&#8217;ll be right down here with us
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And mighty glad to get here, I guess,&#8221; exclaimed
Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send a man up with the rope now,&#8221; said the
captain, and he started to walk away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; cried Grant suddenly. &#8220;What&#8217;s Fred
trying to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s untying the ropes,&#8221; exclaimed String.
&#8220;Is he crazy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he is,&#8221; said Pop. &#8220;It looks as if he was
getting ready to climb down the way he went up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yell at him,&#8221; exclaimed String excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do it,&#8221; cautioned Captain Dodge
quickly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t distract his attention from what he is
doing for a second. It&#8217;s too late now, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fred now stood free and clear of the ropes. It was evident that the
two men with him were arguing with him not to attempt the descent, but
apparently their efforts made no impression on the daring youth, for he
could be seen to shake his head. Then he gingerly lowered himself from
the yard and began the perilous journey to the deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty nervy,&#8221; muttered Captain Dodge under his breath,
and murmurs of admiration could be heard from all the members of the
crew gathered nearby. No one spoke, however, for all eyes and all
interest were focused on the feat Fred was performing.</p>

<p>Slowly and carefully he proceeded at first, but as he gained in
confidence he increased the speed of his descent. Before he had covered
half of the distance he was swinging along as freely and apparently as
carelessly as any sailor. A moment later and he reached the deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good boy,&#8221; cried Captain Dodge, springing forward to
shake hands with Fred, and at the same time a hearty cheer was given by
the crew.</p>

<p>As soon as Fred touched foot on the deck, however, a change came
over him. His face became deathly pale and he swayed dizzily. He put
out his hand to save himself, but before Captain Dodge could reach him
he collapsed and sank to the deck in a limp heap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fainted,&#8221; remarked Grant simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t blame him,&#8221; exclaimed Pop Sanders.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the reaction from the strain probably.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three boys rushed to the side of their comrade and found that
Grant&#8217;s surmise had been correct. Fred had fainted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring some water,&#8221; directed Captain Dodge.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll be around presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fred soon opened his eyes after a few treatments of cold water,
splashed directly in his face. He looked about him and smiled
weakly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you feel?&#8221; asked Captain Dodge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; said Fred, but he didn&#8217;t look so.</p>

<p>&#8220;You better get in your bunk for a while,&#8221; said the
captain. &#8220;That&#8217;s all you need just now. I&#8217;ll tell the
cook to bring you a little hot soup.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaning on Grant and George Washington Sanders, Fred made his way
below. He was very weak after his ordeal and it was with a great sigh
of relief that he sank into his bunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;What made you climb down?&#8221; demanded Pop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Fred, &#8220;I just had to. I knew that if
I didn&#8217;t do it then I never would have the nerve to try again. I
felt so foolish to have caused all the trouble I did and I knew
they&#8217;d all think me an awful landlubber. I felt as if I ought to
square myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did that all right,&#8221; said Grant heartily.
&#8220;The whole crew is crazy about you now, and String and Pop and I
are certainly in the shade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind that part of it,&#8221; said Pop.
&#8220;All I say is, don&#8217;t do it again. I couldn&#8217;t stand
another ten minutes like those.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I tell you one thing,&#8221; said Grant.
&#8220;It&#8217;s lucky for you that the <i>Josephine</i> had been
brought up into the wind. If we had been tacking or beating or
something like that you&#8217;d never had hung so quietly as you
did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we anchored now?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to stay here
until the wind changes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When do you suppose that will be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The captain says it&#8217;ll probably swing around to the
west to-night. As soon as it does we will get under way
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t do it too soon to suit me,&#8221; exclaimed
String. &#8220;I want to be out on the ocean, where you can&#8217;t see
a bit of land in any direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll happen soon enough, once we get started,&#8221;
said Grant. &#8220;Then we&#8217;ll probably wish we were on shore
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment the cook appeared with a bowl of smoking hot soup for
Fred. The cook was named Sam and was as black as ebony.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wh&#8217;ars dat high diver?&#8221; he demanded as he entered the
cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean me?&#8221; smiled Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sho&#8217; do,&#8221; said Sam. &#8220;You suttinly is some
acrobat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not again, I hope,&#8221; said Fred fervently. &#8220;I hope
my troubles are over.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact his troubles and his companions&#8217; had
scarcely begun.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='fss'>A
SUPERSTITIOUS COOK</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Ah&#8217;s afraid ob dis heah boat,&#8221; said Sam as he
handed the soup to Fred and settled himself on the side of the bunk
opposite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid of it?&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got de hoodoo,&#8221; said Sam decidedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Sam,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;What do you mean by
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got de hoodoo, dat&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because Ah feels dat way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why do you feel that way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey&#8217;s a Jonah on board.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah sho&#8217; do,&#8221; said Sam, nodding his ebony head
violently up and down. &#8220;Ah seen him come abo&#8217;d and Ah
knowed right away dat we was gwine ter hab hard luck dis
cruise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know who the Jonah is, then, do you?&#8221; inquired
Grant, somewhat amused by the black man&#8217;s superstitions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah done tol&#8217; you all Ah seen him come
abo&#8217;d,&#8221; said Sam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat Finn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What Finn?&#8221; demanded Fred. &#8220;What is his
name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah doan&#8217; know his name, but he am de Jonah all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does he look like?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like all de Finns,&#8221; said Sam. &#8220;Big, wid light
hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean Mr. Johnson, the mate, do you?&#8221;
said Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suttinly not. Mr. Johnson am a Swede.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who can it be, do you suppose?&#8221; asked Grant of Fred and
String and Pop. The four friends were much interested in what Sam had
to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey calls him Pete,&#8221; said Sam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Petersen?&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;The man who went
up the mast with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s de one,&#8221; said Sam with great conviction.
&#8220;He am a Jonah. Jus&#8217; so long as he is on dis boat we is
boun&#8217; to hab hard luck. He was de one who was responsible
fo&#8217; you all doin&#8217; dat dive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How silly,&#8221; laughed Fred. &#8220;You don&#8217;t think
he pushed me, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah ain&#8217;t sayin&#8217; as how he done actually pushed
you,&#8221; said Sam mysteriously. &#8220;All de same he was
&#8217;sponsible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you suspect him, Sam?&#8221; asked String
curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he am a Finn,&#8221; said Sam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the only reason?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t dat enuff?&#8221; exclaimed Sam.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a Finn, ain&#8217;t he? Well, doan&#8217; you all
know dat Finns is hard luck?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never knew it,&#8221; said Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well it&#8217;s de truth jus&#8217; de same,&#8221; said
Sam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is that?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah doan&#8217; know nothin&#8217; about why it is,&#8221;
said Sam. &#8220;All Ah knows is dat Finns is hard luck on boats
an&#8217; always has been.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can they do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey say,&#8221; whispered Sam in a low voice and leaning
forward after a glance around the cabin, &#8220;dat dey can make de
wind blow or dey can make it stop blowin&#8217;. Dey can make de storms
come and if dey tries real hard dey can wreck de whole ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By doing what?&#8221; asked Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;By doin&#8217; nothin&#8217;,&#8221; replied Sam confidently.
&#8220;Dey jus&#8217; sits in de cabin and thinks and thinks and
wha&#8217;soever dey thinks about is boun&#8217; to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do to get one of them mad at you then,
would it?&#8221; remarked Pop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah should say not,&#8221; exclaimed Sam with great
conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you ever sailed with Finns before?&#8221; asked
Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once, an&#8217; dat time we had nothin&#8217; but head winds
an&#8217; calms all de blessed time. Dat proves what Ah say about dem
Finns, doan&#8217; it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think the Finn was responsible, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah is sho&#8217; of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll hope you&#8217;re wrong, Sam,&#8221; laughed Pop.
&#8220;Certainly we&#8217;re not looking for hard luck. We&#8217;re out
for fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah hopes yo&#8217; all has it,&#8221; said Sam, but he shook
his head doubtfully and muttered to himself as he took the empty soup
bowl from Fred&#8217;s hands and carried it off into the galley.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a queer one,&#8221; said Pop laughing as he
watched the cook&#8217;s disappearing figure. &#8220;Imagine accusing
all Finns of being hard luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty tough on the race, I should say,&#8221;
said String.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; laughed Pop, &#8220;and just imagine what would
happen if we were over in Finland. There certainly must be a lot of
hard luck there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Sam doesn&#8217;t know any better,&#8221; said Grant.
&#8220;He&#8217;s ignorant and like all darkies is superstitious.
Sailors are too, and as Sam is a combination of both he is worse than
usual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s made me feel sort of queer though,&#8221; said
Fred. &#8220;Of course it&#8217;s silly and I suppose it&#8217;s partly
because I&#8217;m nervous after fainting but I feel as if something was
hanging over us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be foolish, Fred,&#8221; exclaimed Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get over it all right,&#8221; said Fred lightly.
&#8220;At the same time Sam&#8217;s talk has gotten me stirred up
some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forget it,&#8221; urged Pop briefly. &#8220;Come on up on
deck and see what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll stay here in my bunk a little
while,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t quite recovered my
nerve yet. You fellows go on up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see you
later.&#8221;</p>

<p>They made their way up on deck and found that the <i>Josephine</i>
was still at anchor and that the wind instead of changing was blowing
in the same direction and seemed fresher than formerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Finn&#8217;s giving us head winds,&#8221; said Pop in a
low voice to his companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Petersen over there now,&#8221; remarked
String. &#8220;He certainly looks harmless enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I guess he is,&#8221; added Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fred isn&#8217;t sure of it any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll feel differently about it when he has recovered
from the shock he had,&#8221; said Grant confidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; String admitted doubtfully. &#8220;Fred gets
queer notions though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s ask Captain Dodge about it,&#8221; exclaimed
Grant. &#8220;There he is now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s the patient?&#8221; asked the captain cheerily as
the boys approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;He finished all the soup
that Sam brought him, I noticed. We were talking to Sam down in the
cabin and he has gotten Fred excited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about?&#8221; demanded the captain curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says there is a Jonah on board and that we&#8217;re going
to have hard luck all through the voyage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds just like Sam,&#8221; laughed the captain. &#8220;Who
did he say the Jonah is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Petersen, the man who went up the mast with Fred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he&#8217;s a Finn?&#8221; asked Captain Dodge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with
Finns anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Captain Dodge, &#8220;there&#8217;s an old
superstition among sailors that they bring bad luck. I had almost
forgotten it, but as soon as you said that Sam suspected Petersen I
remembered that he is a Finn and that Sam would probably believe in the
old story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it&#8217;s not true,&#8221; said John Clemens.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we needn&#8217;t worry about it,&#8221; said the
captain, smiling. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t bother me any but if you boys
want to go ashore it isn&#8217;t too late yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t feel as bad about it as that,&#8221; laughed
Grant. &#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll risk it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right anyway,&#8221; exclaimed Pop Sanders.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got my compass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of him, captain?&#8221; exclaimed John.
&#8220;He always carries a compass on a string around his
neck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Captain Dodge. &#8220;In
case he is shipwrecked he can tell in which direction he is going
anyway. Not that that knowledge would do him very much good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And my diary,&#8221; added Pop. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget
that. I always carry a diary in my hip pocket with a little pencil in
it so that I can jot things down just as soon as they happen or rather
when I think to do it. You see when you have it with you you are more
apt to keep it up to date.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good idea,&#8221; said the captain warmly. &#8220;I see
that you are a very methodical young man and probably I shall get you
to keep the log for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you wouldn&#8217;t want me to do that,&#8221; laughed
Pop. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it wouldn&#8217;t be done very
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>All day long the boys lolled about on the deck. Fred had joined his
companions and the four friends discussed what they should do when they
arrived at Buenos Aires, the beautiful South American city of which
they had heard so much. They talked of a sailor&#8217;s life and all
its hardships and its pleasures. Like everything else it is a mixture
of good and bad and too much of either is harmful anyway.</p>

<p>After supper that evening the wind died down. The water became
almost as quiet as a mill pond and more than one of the four friends
whispered to his comrades that the Finn was at the bottom of it all.
George Sanders mentioned this to Captain Dodge in a joking way but the
captain only laughed and said, &#8220;Wait. Unless I am very much
mistaken we&#8217;ll have a fine favoring wind inside of two
hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>His prophecy was soon fulfilled too, for in a short time a damp
night-breeze sprang up out of the west. Up came the anchor, the sails
were set, and the <i>Josephine</i> slid ghost-like down through the
narrows, around Sandy Hook and out into the open sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re off, String,&#8221; exclaimed George Sanders
joyously. The two boys were standing near the forward hatchway looking
out across the black water. If Pop had known what awaited them perhaps
he would not have been quite so light hearted.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='fss'>A
CODE</span></h2>

<p>The breeze held strongly and the <i>Josephine</i> made splendid
progress. The life on shipboard had endless attractions for the four
young boys. They learned the parts of the ship, the names of the sails
and how to navigate. Sailors taught them to splice ropes and how to tie
the hundred and one knots familiar to those who follow the sea. The
weather was ideal and as everything went well, all on board were in
excellent spirits.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess Sam was wrong about this hard luck business,&#8221;
remarked John Clemens one day to Grant Jones. The two boys were
standing near the bow of the brig, watching two of Mother Carey&#8217;s
chickens, those friendly little birds that follow and play around boats
even out in the middle of the ocean.</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly looks so, String,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;We
can&#8217;t hold much against the Finn so far, can we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not. Let&#8217;s hope it keeps up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how it can,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;So
far it has been almost too good to be true, and I don&#8217;t see how
it can last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it will though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sam says not. He says that maybe we have escaped so far but
he still insists we&#8217;re going to have something happen to us
before we&#8217;re through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s cheerful, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221; laughed John.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not worrying though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Johnson says that we&#8217;re almost bound to strike bad
weather when we get into the gulf-stream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know except for what he said. He says that
sometimes you can see the low banks of clouds over the gulf-stream and
that you may run from a clear sky and light wind, with all sail, into a
heavy sea and cloudy sky where you&#8217;ll need double
reefs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that queer,&#8221; exclaimed John. &#8220;I
wonder when we&#8217;ll reach it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fairly soon, I should say,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;We must
be getting pretty far south by now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are. Captain Dodge told me we&#8217;d be in the West
Indies before long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we could stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to see everything,&#8221; laughed John.
&#8220;We&#8217;re going to South America, aren&#8217;t we? What more
do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment Fred and George Sanders approached the two boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to be Sons of Neptune in a few days,&#8221;
exclaimed George gayly as he and Fred came up to the place where their
two friends were standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that, Pop?&#8221; asked John
curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I say, String, my boy,&#8221; said George.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to tell me that you don&#8217;t know what a
Son of Neptune is! Every man that sails any of the seven seas ought to
know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be funny, Pop,&#8221; warned John, assuming a
threatening attitude. &#8220;Tell me what it means and be quick about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You swear you don&#8217;t know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard what I said, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; grinned Pop, &#8220;but you know I don&#8217;t
believe half what you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Throw him overboard, String,&#8221; urged Fred.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t fool with him any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just about what I had decided to do,&#8221; said
John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; cried Pop, stepping forward and holding up his
hand dramatically. &#8220;Spare my life and I will tell all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quick about it then,&#8221; warned John. &#8220;I
shan&#8217;t fool with you much longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said Pop, pretending to be greatly alarmed.
&#8220;I know it, String, and I must say I am awfully
frightened.&#8221;</p>

<p>John stepped forward and raised his hands as if he was about to
seize George W. Sanders by the neck. He had no opportunity to do so,
however.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell. I&#8217;ll tell,&#8221; cried Pop
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you till I count three,&#8221; said John.
&#8220;One, two&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man becomes a Son of Neptune,&#8221; said George,
&#8220;when he has crossed the equator on a boat. Now will you promise
not to hurt me? Not that you could do it if you tried,&#8221; he added,
but he muttered the words so softly to himself that no one else heard
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that what a Son of Neptune is?&#8221; exclaimed John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, String, that&#8217;s what a Son of Neptune is,&#8221;
said George, imitating as nearly as possible his friend&#8217;s tone of
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you?&#8221; demanded Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has that got to do with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you?&#8221; repeated Grant sharply.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to take some of this freshness out of him
pretty soon, String,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;We surely will,&#8221; agreed John readily. &#8220;I&#8217;m
ready at any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The four friends loved to tease and banter one another and
oftentimes an outsider might have thought from their conversation that
they had lost their tempers. Such, however, was never the case. They
knew one another too well and all had too much sense for any such
foolishness. In particular they all liked to tease and threaten Pop
Sanders, though in any contest of wits he usually held his own and the
threats of his comrades had no effect upon him whatever.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the third and last time, who told you?&#8221; demanded
Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Petersen told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been talking to the Finn, have you?&#8221;
exclaimed Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and he&#8217;s a nice fellow, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ll get his hard luck away from him,&#8221;
laughed Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he&#8217;s had hard luck himself all right,&#8221;
said Pop seriously. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean he&#8217;ll give it
to others though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What hard luck has he had?&#8221; asked John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, his father died when he was a baby and he was left with
a big family of children to be brought up by his mother. She had no
money and of course had an awfully hard time of it. Two of his sisters
died of scarlet fever, a younger brother was drowned and finally his
mother got pneumonia and she died. I call that pretty tough luck
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; agreed Grant readily.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Sam heard all those things he&#8217;d surely say it was
because it was a family of Finns,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;He&#8217;d
say they brought hard luck to one another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He probably would,&#8221; laughed Pop. &#8220;Still I feel
sorry for a fellow who has had all that trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did his father do?&#8221; asked John.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a bad character principally, I guess,&#8221; said Pop.
&#8220;He was also a sailor at times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have had quite a long talk with Petersen,
Pop,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;How did he happen to get so
confidential?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. We just got talking, that&#8217;s all,
and the first thing I knew he began to tell me the story of his
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His father left the family no money, I imagine,&#8221; said
Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not. He left debts. The only thing he left was a
bad reputation and this thing which Petersen gave to me,&#8221; and as
he spoke Pop reached in his hip pocket and brought out what appeared to
be a dirty piece of old paper, folded up.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded Grant quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said George. &#8220;See for
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed the object in question to Grant who straightway unfolded
it and glanced at it eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing but a lot of numbers,&#8221; he exclaimed
disappointedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said George. &#8220;Just a lot of old faded
numbers written on a piece of parchment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it supposed to be?&#8221; asked John
curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Petersen thinks it&#8217;s some sort of a code. Maybe it is
but I think myself it is nothing at all, and that it might as well be
thrown overboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes him think it&#8217;s a code?&#8221; said
Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing much that I know of,&#8221; replied Pop. &#8220;He
said it was found sewed inside the lining of a coat his father used to
have and so he thought it must be valuable. He said that the neighbors
used to tell some kind of weird stories about his father having been
connected with buried treasure or something like that, and he is sure
this has something to do with it. Personally I think he is mistaken
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he thinks it so valuable why did he give it to you?&#8221;
demanded Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t really give it to me to keep. He wanted me to
try and decipher the code and tell him what it says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you do it?&#8221; laughed John.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you Son of Neptune,&#8221; exclaimed George. &#8220;I did
not. I offered to read the numbers to him, but he said he could do that
much himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s this treasure buried?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what Petersen wants to find out,&#8221;
said Pop. &#8220;That certainly was an awfully smart question to ask,
Fred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought he might know the island or whatever it is where
the stuff is supposed to be buried, but not the exact location of the
jewels on the island.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know it&#8217;s jewels?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It always is, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about it,&#8221; said Pop.
&#8220;For all we know Petersen may be playing a joke on us.
We&#8217;re all landlubbers of course and the crew might have decided
to initiate us a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; agreed John. &#8220;The parchment looks old
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are the numbers, Grant?&#8221; asked Fred. &#8220;Read
them out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty,&#8221; began Grant when he was interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Add &#8217;em up, you fellows,&#8221; laughed George.
&#8220;The total tells how old Anne is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him read them, Pop,&#8221; urged John. &#8220;Give him a
chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty, one, eleven, five, one, three, fifteen, twenty-one,
eighteen, nineteen, five.&#8221; Grant paused. &#8220;That&#8217;s a
funny thing&#8221; he said. &#8220;Every number is distinctly separated
from the next one. It certainly seems as if it must mean
something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll tell Petersen that you are going to
solve the mystery, Socrates, my boy,&#8221; laughed Pop. &#8220;Shall
I?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Grant could answer there was a shout. A few sharp orders were
given and immediately everything on board the <i>Josephine</i> was
bustle and hurry. The crew came rushing out on deck, and scattered
hither and thither all over the brig in obedience to the orders that
were being given so rapidly. An anxious look was on the faces of all
the men.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='fss'>A TROPICAL
STORM</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this?&#8221; exclaimed Grant, startled by
the sudden change that had come over the boat.</p>

<p>The four boys looked about them in surprise, unable to account for
the transformation. Petersen was forgotten; jewels and treasure were
forgotten; even the strange code was forgotten and Grant
absent-mindedly thrust it into his trouser&#8217;s pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, do you suppose?&#8221; he exclaimed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look over there and you&#8217;ll see,&#8221; said Fred.</p>

<p>He pointed to the westward and as his three friends gazed in the
direction he had indicated they soon saw the cause of all the
commotion. Far off on the western horizon appeared a cloud. That in
itself was no special reason for alarm, but it was a very peculiar
looking cloud. It was grayish-black in color and shaped like a funnel.
Long ragged strips had separated themselves from the main body and hung
like long wisps from the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it&#8217;s a tornado?&#8221; exclaimed John, in
a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, String,&#8221; said Pop. &#8220;It looks
bad though, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does to me all right,&#8221; said Fred grimly. &#8220;The
captain must think it is pretty serious too from all the preparations
that are being made.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re taking in some of the sails,&#8221; remarked
Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;When
that storm hits us I don&#8217;t want any more canvas spread than is
necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it won&#8217;t hit us,&#8221; said George
hopefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an optimist, Pop, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; said
Fred. &#8220;I think it&#8217;ll hit us all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The breeze is going down,&#8221; said John suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It surely is,&#8221; agreed Grant. &#8220;The lull before the
storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at that cloud now,&#8221; exclaimed Fred.
&#8220;It&#8217;s spreading all over the sky and see how fast it is
going. It&#8217;ll be dark in a few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t they take the rest of the sails in?&#8221;
demanded John nervously. &#8220;I must say I don&#8217;t like
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve taken in the topsails and the mizzen,&#8221;
said Grant. &#8220;That&#8217;s a big part.&#8221;</p>

<p>A lull had now come over the crew and the four young friends were
unconsciously affected by it. Now there was not a breath of air
stirring; the sails hung heavy and motionless from the yards. Blacker
and blacker grew the sky; the stillness all about became appalling. No
one spoke a word, but every one stood around as though waiting for
something serious to happen. The crew was gathered about the forward
hatchway silently watching the approach of the storm.</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson, the mate, went forward and gave some order in a low
tone. More sails were taken in, all in a solemn and quiet manner. The
brig now lay motionless on the water while an uneasy expectation of
something threatening seemed to hang overhead. The suspense was
terrible. Captain Dodge paced silently up and down the deck but he
spoke to no one and no one spoke to him. It was now so dark it was
almost impossible to see the length of the ship.</p>

<p>Again Mr. Johnson came forward and gave another low-voiced command.
Two sailors, one of whom was Petersen, started up the mast to clew down
the main top-gallant sail. They had just reached the fore-top-gallant
yard when a strange thing happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; cried John, in an awe struck voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; demanded Fred in a frightened
whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;A corposant,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;I&#8217;ve read about
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Over and directly above the heads of the two sailors appeared a
light. It was in the shape of a ball and hung to the very top of the
mast.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a corposant?&#8221; whispered John.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Grant, &#8220;except that
that&#8217;s what they call a ball of light like that one. If it goes
up it&#8217;s supposed to be good luck, but if it comes down it&#8217;s
bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish Petersen wasn&#8217;t up there,&#8221; muttered
Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly, Fred,&#8221; exclaimed Grant sharply.
The tension was affecting every one&#8217;s nerves. It was almost pitch
dark on the <i>Josephine</i> now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it,&#8221; insisted Fred. &#8220;I wish it
was some one else up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone,&#8221; remarked John suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; George corrected. &#8220;There it
is, down on the yard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It came down then,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;I knew it
would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t blame Petersen,&#8221; exclaimed Grant.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not his fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two sailors had climbed down quickly after their task was
completed and now joined the rest of the crew. All together they stood
and watched the strange light until after playing about the mast for
some ten minutes or so it disappeared as suddenly as it had come.</p>

<p>Somebody passed the spot where the four boys stood. It was too dark
to make out who it was but the young sailors could hear him moaning and
groaning to himself. &#8220;Dat Finn,&#8221; he groaned. &#8220;Oh,
Lawdy, dat Finn. Ah knowed it all de time. We sho&#8217; is goners
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes Sam,&#8221; whispered Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him go,&#8221; said Grant shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here comes the rain,&#8221; exclaimed John suddenly.</p>

<p>A few huge drops fell upon the deck and at the same time the
darkness seemed to grow even deeper than before.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s thunder too,&#8221; said George. A few low
rumbles were heard, while off to the southwest appeared some random
flashes of lightning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the storm?&#8221; demanded Fred. &#8220;So far
nothing has happened. This stillness and darkness are getting on my
nerves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; counseled Grant, and scarcely had he spoken when
there was a blinding flash of light. Almost at the same instant came a
deafening peal of thunder. The sky directly overhead seemed to open up
and down came the water in torrents.</p>

<p>Unconsciously the four boys drew closer together, so startled were
they by this unexpected happening. It seemed as if the brig must have
been struck but evidently it had escaped, for a second later there was
another flash and report and the bare masts could be seen outlined
against the inky sky.</p>

<p>Flash followed flash in quick succession. The whole ocean was
lighted up by the constant blaze of light. Peal after peal rattled
overhead with a noise so violent that it seemed as if the whole earth
must be shaken. After a few moments the deluge of rain abated but the
thunder and the lightning continued incessantly. So far there had not
been a breath of air stirring; the <i>Josephine</i> lay motionless on
the surface of the ocean and seemed to the people on board of her an
excellent and easy target for the fury of the elements.</p>

<p>Several times one of the boys started to speak but his words were
lost in the roar of the storm. They were almost blinded by the
lightning but no one thought of going below. This was their first
experience in a tropical storm and they were frightened. They would not
have been ashamed to admit it either. They did not care to go to their
bunks, for every one wanted to be on deck where he could see what was
going on.</p>

<p>The lightning played all about the ship and it seemed a miracle that
she was not hit. It seemed to run up and down the masts, across the
yards and over the anchors, but thus far the <i>Josephine</i> had
escaped. All this time there had been no wind; the brig lay motionless
and powerless to move.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a blinding flash and a ripping, tearing sound
accompanied by the smell of burnt wood. So severe had been the blaze of
light that every one was temporarily blinded by it and for a few
seconds everything looked red. A moment later, however, when the crew
had recovered somewhat from the shock a great shouting and running to
and fro began.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re hit,&#8221; cried Grant, the first to regain his
senses.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ship&#8217;s on fire,&#8221; shouted Fred excitedly.</p>

<p>As he spoke a few red tongues of flame appeared from the hatch.
Orders were instantly given and a brigade to fight the fire was formed
almost at once. It was difficult work, however, for the night was so
dark that it was nearly impossible to see one&#8217;s way around the
deck. The flashes of lightning were about the only help afforded to the
emergency firemen.</p>

<p>The four young friends were among the first to join in this work.
Buckets were passed from hand to hand and the men worked feverishly. No
one shirked for an instant and in fact no one dared to do so, for
without their ship the men were nearly helpless, left to the mercy of
the ocean.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wind&#8217;s coming up,&#8221; exclaimed Grant
suddenly.</p>

<p>What he said was true. It was also raining hard once more, though
the thunder and lightning had somewhat abated.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wind means our finish,&#8221; said Fred grimly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll never stop this fire now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must,&#8221; cried John doggedly. &#8220;We&#8217;re lost
if we don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every one redoubled his efforts but the fire gained steadily. Higher
and higher leaped the flames and farther and farther astern they crept.
The crew worked like demons but their task was hopeless. The fire was
too mighty for them and it was soon evident to every one on board that
the <i>Josephine</i> was a doomed ship.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span
class='fss'>ADRIFT</span></h2>

<p>Captain Dodge stood near by urging on his men. Nor did he shirk any
of the work himself. He fought the flames with all the fury of a
determined man, but it soon became plain that it was an unequal
struggle and that the <i>Josephine</i> would never reach Buenos Aires
or any other port for that matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Man the boats!&#8221; shouted the captain.</p>

<p>The lifeboats were loosened on the davits and made ready to launch.
A stock of provisions was placed on board of every one of them and
preparations were made to embark. The four Go Ahead boys were assigned
to one boat, together with Sam the cook and Petersen the Finn
sailor.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll never do,&#8221; said John in a low voice to
Grant. &#8220;Sam and Petersen in the same boat are bound to have
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid so myself, String,&#8221; said Grant,
&#8220;but what can we do? Captain Dodge gave the orders and we must do
as he says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t he change them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He might, of course, but I&#8217;m not going to ask him
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said John ruefully, &#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose
we could do that. I guess we&#8217;ll have to put up with
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wind had been steadily increasing in violence since the fire
started and now was blowing almost a gale. It whipped the waves into
foam and whistled and shrieked through the rigging. The fire, fanned by
the breeze, now roared menacingly while its volume increased steadily.
It was only too evident that it would be impossible to remain on board
the <i>Josephine</i> many moments more.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better get away from here,&#8221; said Fred
nervously, as he watched the mass of flame and smoke which now
enveloped the whole forward part of the ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we do leave we won&#8217;t be much better off,&#8221;
said Pop gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same I&#8217;d rather take my chances with the ocean
than with this fire,&#8221; exclaimed Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we going!&#8221; demanded John.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do I know!&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;We must leave,
that&#8217;s sure. What we are to do after we leave is another
matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand by to lower away!&#8221; came the order.</p>

<p>The four boys sprang to their positions. Petersen and Sam joined
them a moment later. The negro cook was half-crazed with fear and still
kept mumbling to himself, &#8220;Dat Finn, dat Finn.&#8221; Undoubtedly
he did not understand that Petersen was to go on the same boat with him
or he would not have consented to step aboard. Now, in the darkness it
was almost impossible to recognize anybody and Sam probably had no idea
who any of his companions were to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lower away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boats descended rapidly and soon rested upon the water where
they danced and bobbed about like corks on the angry waves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get aboard, Sam,&#8221; urged Grant.</p>

<p>Making no objection, the negro quickly lowered himself into the
waiting boat. Fred, John, Grant and George followed in order, leaving
only Petersen on board the brig. He stood with the painter in his hand,
awaiting the word to leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unship your oars,&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; answered Grant.</p>

<p>There were two pairs of oars in the boat and every one of the four
boys took charge of one of them. Sam cowered in the bow of the boat
shuddering and still murmuring over and over again, &#8220;Dat Finn,
dat Finn.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the sound of Petersen&#8217;s voice from the deck above, however,
he half raised himself. &#8220;Who dat talkin&#8217;?&#8221; he
demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the sailors,&#8221; said Grant carelessly, knowing
what was passing in the black man&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat Petersen,&#8221; said Sam. &#8220;Am he comin&#8217; on
dis heah boat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Grant answered evasively.</p>

<p>&#8220;He bettah not. He bettah not,&#8221; said Sam fiercely.
&#8220;We&#8217;s had enough hard luck on account ob dat man
already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t his fault,&#8221; said Grant trying to quiet
the excited negro.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was! It was!&#8221; Sam fairly shouted, at the same time
trying to stand up in the skiff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, Sam,&#8221; ordered Fred sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah won&#8217;t sit down,&#8221; the cook cried menacingly.
&#8220;Ah won&#8217;t do nothin&#8217; if dat Finn am gwine git in dis
heah boat. Ah tells yo&#8217; all we&#8217;s had enough hard luck on
account of dat man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll sit down or get out of the boat,&#8221; said
Grant threateningly. &#8220;We won&#8217;t take any fooling here
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sam subsided, but he still mumbled to himself incessantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, get aboard,&#8221; John called to Petersen, though
he took care not to call him by name.</p>

<p>Petersen threw the painter and jumped into the stern of the
life-boat. The four oarsmen dug their blades into the water and the
little craft shot forward. The other boats had also left and the
<i>Josephine</i> was now a blazing mass of wood. Sparks shot high into
the air and in all directions only to fall with a hiss into the angry
waters of the sea. The roar of the flames could be heard even above the
noise of the storm which seemed to be increasing in intensity.</p>

<p>The four boys rowed a couple of hundred yards away from the burning
brig and then rested on their oars and watched the destruction of the
ship on which they had expected to go to South America. She was
entirely enveloped in flames now and presented a wonderful but terrible
sight as she was rapidly being devoured by the hungry fire.</p>

<p>All the occupants but one of the boat watched the fire. That one was
Sam. He still remained huddled in the bow and never once did he look
back. He moaned and groaned and raved until the rest of the party began
to think that perhaps he was losing his mind.</p>

<p>Farther and farther from the burning ship drifted the tiny boat. All
that the crew of it could do was to keep the stern straight into the
waves and straighten her out when a great roller sent them flying.
Lower and lower appeared the hull of the <i>Josephine</i>, when an
occasional glimpse could be had of her from the crest of some huge
wave. At length she disappeared, entirely burned to the water&#8217;s
edge, and thus came the end of another brave ship. One more was added
to the great ocean graveyard, already thick with the bones of many a
gallant merchantman.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gone,&#8221; said George soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said John, &#8220;and what&#8217;s going to
happen to us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We may be picked up,&#8221; exclaimed Fred hopefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we may not,&#8221; added Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know where we are?&#8221; he asked of Petersen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no idea,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;Somewhere
near the West Indies, or maybe we&#8217;re right in them now for all I
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll soon find land,&#8221; said Fred as
cheerfully as was possible under the circumstances.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it isn&#8217;t the land that&#8217;s at the bottom of
the ocean,&#8221; said George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so pessimistic, Pop,&#8221; urged Fred.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. We&#8217;re in a bad fix, that&#8217;s
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out for this wave!&#8221; warned Grant suddenly as a
great mountain of water loomed up behind them.</p>

<p>The little boat was driven along at the speed of a race horse for
many, many yards, but fortunately she remained right side up. The four
boys managed their oars skillfully and Petersen steered marvelously.
Now and then some water was shipped but aside from that no harm came to
them.</p>

<p>Gradually the wind died down and the storm abated. Night had now
come upon them, however, and they were in a sorry plight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the other boats?&#8221; asked Grant when an hour of
silence had elapsed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no idea,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;Has any one seen
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>No one had. At least every one denied it but Sam, and as he had not
once looked around him there was no chance that he had seen anything.
Now he was asleep. He had made no move to help in any way and seemed to
take it for granted that the others would look after him. His last
words before he had closed his eyes were, &#8220;Dat Finn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got some provisions, anyway,&#8221; said
John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed George, &#8220;but how long do you think
they&#8217;ll last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty long enough to keep us going until we are picked
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so sure of that,&#8221; George advised.
&#8220;At any rate, we have no water, and that&#8217;s even more
important than food.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we have, too, Pop,&#8221; corrected Fred.
&#8220;It&#8217;s right under my feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, salt water, though,&#8221; grumbled George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. There&#8217;s a cask of fresh water right here in
the bottom of the boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me some, then,&#8221; exclaimed George eagerly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m half dead with thirst as it is now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t drink it now, Pop,&#8221; urged Grant. &#8220;We
may be hard pressed for water, as you say, and I think we&#8217;d all
better wait till morning. Then we can take stock of just what we have
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Grant,&#8221; agreed John heartily.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think so, too, Petersen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do. We can surely get along without food and water until
light comes, but in a day or so we may need it very badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think we&#8217;ll be out here that long?&#8221; demanded
Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Still you never can tell, and it&#8217;s
always well to be prepared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; acknowledged George. &#8220;At any
rate, I don&#8217;t want any water.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a characteristic of these four boys that they were usually
cheerful under any and all conditions. No matter how hard a thing might
be, they bore it willingly if it was necessary. They made complaints if
they thought it was unnecessary, but when they knew it was the only
thing to be done they never raised a murmur. No sportsman ever
complains of a thing that is fair, and what is best for the most people
is always fair.</p>

<p>Hour after hour dragged by. To the little band on board the
life-boat it seemed as if morning would never come. The storm had
passed, but the water was still rough and the night still inky dark.
Now and again the boys dozed off and caught a few winks of sleep. No
attempt to row had been made for several hours. Petersen steered the
boat and was the only one who did not rest. Incessantly through the
long night he guided the little craft and watched over the safety of
those on board.</p>

<p>At last morning came. The first faint streaks of light thrust their
rosy fingers up over the eastern horizon and soon the whole sky was
covered with an orange glow. Little by little the faint outlines of the
occupants of the life boat became visible. What a sorry looking crew it
was, too. Disheveled, dirty and unkempt, they plainly showed the
effects of their harrowing experience.</p>

<p>As the light crept over the ocean it showed some of the party
asleep. The others were haggard and worn looking and seemed to have but
small concern as to what happened to them. They lolled on the cross
seats in a listless way, not at all interested in the beautiful
sunrise. They were more concerned in their own welfare than in the
beauties of Nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hum,&#8221; yawned Sam, raising himself from the position
in which he had lain all night. &#8220;We sho&#8217; has had a powerful
lot of hard&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught sight of Petersen and suddenly ceased talking. A change
came over his face as he recognized the man to whom he charged the hard
luck that had overtaken them. Hate spread itself over the features of
the superstitious negro and his breath came in short gasps as if some
one was choking him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dar yo&#8217; are!&#8221; he exclaimed fiercely. &#8220;Dar
yo&#8217; are, yo&#8217; hard luck Finn. I&#8217;ll fix
yo&#8217;,&#8221; and he started to make his way towards the stern of
the boat to the spot where his enemy was seated.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='fss'>A DESPERATE
STRUGGLE</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, Sam! Sit down!&#8221; cried Fred, who was placed
nearest him. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you? Are you
crazy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sam, however, made no answer. He strode forward toward the object of
his hatred, paying no attention to Fred&#8217;s words and showing an
absolute disregard of the danger of falling overboard. Fortunately in
this peril the boat was heavy and very steady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get back there!&#8221; cried Fred in alarm, trying to grab
Sam&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lemme go,&#8221; said Sam roughly, knocking Fred&#8217;s hand
aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grab him, John. Grab him,&#8221; shouted Fred as the excited
negro made his way past the seat where he was located.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lemme go,&#8221; said Sam darkly, and seeing the look on his
face John drew back instinctively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold him, Grant! Grab him, Pop!&#8221; shrieked Fred, at the
same time rising to his feet and attempting to catch Sam from
behind.</p>

<p>He was too late, however. Sam, seeing that he might be balked in his
purpose, took no more chances. He made one flying leap almost over the
heads of Grant and George, who were waiting to seize him. This was done
so unexpectedly that the two boys were taken by surprise, and though
they tried to do as Fred had begged them, they were unsuccessful. Sam
tripped and fell forward, but when he landed he fell squarely on top of
his enemy.</p>

<p>The boat rocked dangerously. Fred was thrown from his feet and fell
headlong to the bottom of the boat. In falling his head struck one of
the thwarts, so stunning him that he was unable to move.</p>

<p>&#8220;Separate &#8217;em, Grant!&#8221; cried John. &#8220;Stop
that fight!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grant threw himself upon the contestants and tried to pinion
Sam&#8217;s arms behind his back. The negro and the sailor were both
powerful men, however, and Grant was thrown violently backward as
though he had been a mere fly. George caught him just in time to
prevent his going overboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stop them,&#8221; he gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit him on the head,&#8221; cried John. &#8220;Do anything.
Make &#8217;em stop. Here, let me get down there,&#8221; he begged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; shouted George. &#8220;Sit down, John, or
you&#8217;ll have us all upset.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t, either. Let me get by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, String,&#8221; begged Grant. &#8220;Keep your
seat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take this oar, then,&#8221; cried John. &#8220;Hit that coon
on the head with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too big,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;Give me
something smaller and I&#8217;ll hit him all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men in the stern of the boat were locked in each
other&#8217;s embrace. Sam had had the advantage, for he had landed on
top of his adversary. Petersen, however, had muscles of steel, hardened
by years of service and labor on shipboard. He tried to grab the black
man by the throat. The two slipped to the bottom of the boat, where
they struggled for the mastery until the veins stood out on their
temples and the sweat rolled from them in streams. Their breath came in
gasps. It was a strange sight that the early tropical sun looked down
upon.</p>

<p>They wrestled and writhed about on the bottom of the boat, first one
on top and then the other. It seemed miraculous that they did not go
overboard. The space in which they struggled was so limited that it was
next to impossible for any one of the boys to get himself in a position
to separate the fighters. Several times Grant tried, but he was always
driven back, and after several narrow escapes from falling into the
water he gave up the attempt. Fred still lay quietly in the bow, too
dazed to be of assistance.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must stop this,&#8221; cried John. &#8220;They&#8217;ll
kill each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, String,&#8221; agreed Grant, &#8220;but what can
we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit Sam over the head. He&#8217;s the one that started
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t get to his head. His feet are pointed this way
and every time I try I get a few swift kicks and nothing
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we must do something to stop them,&#8221; urged
George.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Pop,&#8221; said Grant grimly. &#8220;You suggest
something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there a club in the boat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Throw water on them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We might do that,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;Hand me that
canvas bucket, String.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grant filled it to the brim with water and then soused it as nearly
as he could into the faces of the fighters. The only effect it seemed
to have was to revive them both and the struggle was continued with
renewed fury.</p>

<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t do,&#8221; cried Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to be a question of who will weaken first,&#8221;
remarked John, grimly. &#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll have to sit and watch
until that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; exclaimed George. &#8220;I say we all pile
on and make them quit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And all go overboard if we try that,&#8221; said Grant.
&#8220;You forget that we&#8217;re in a boat, Pop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me up there, then,&#8221; urged George. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure I can end the fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grant gave way to his comrade, only too willing to let some one else
try his hand at the problem. They changed places carefully and George
prepared to put his plan into execution.</p>

<p>&#8220;You better stay here beside me, Grant,&#8221; he exclaimed
suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll each grab a foot and pull for all we&#8217;re
worth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What good will that do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we can pull one of them away it ought to stop the fight,
oughtn&#8217;t it? A man can&#8217;t fight with himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Grant. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see what
we can do, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful now,&#8221; advised George as Grant took his place
beside him. &#8220;This is pretty ticklish business.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two boys knelt side by side on one of the seats. They leaned
forward, eagerly waiting for a chance to seize the infuriated negro by
his feet. This was no easy task, however, for his feet flew in all
directions and kicked viciously backward, so that a few bruises were
the sole results of the first attempts of the two boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit him on the shins,&#8221; advised John.
&#8220;That&#8217;ll fix him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try this first,&#8221; said Grant doggedly. His
knuckles were bleeding and his forearms were sore from the treatment he
had received from Sam&#8217;s boots. The pain made him angry and more
determined than ever to accomplish his purpose.</p>

<p>The fight was now desperate, even more so than before. No human
beings could continue at such a killing pace for long, however. Sam
still had the advantage which he had held from the beginning. His great
powerful hands were now feeling for Petersen&#8217;s throat, and from
the expression in the Finn&#8217;s eyes it was evident that he could
not hold out much longer. Help must come to him and come quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got him,&#8221; cried Grant suddenly as he caught
hold of one of Sam&#8217;s feet. &#8220;Grab the other one, Pop.
Quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>George grabbed all right, and held on, too. He received a blow over
an eye which opened up an ugly cut, but still he hung on
desperately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, pull!&#8221; shouted John. &#8220;Pull with all your
might!&#8221;</p>

<p>Both boys exerted themselves to the utmost. They braced themselves
and pulled with all the strength that was in them. It was difficult for
them even to hang on, however, for Sam struggled desperately and the
two boys were thrown all about. Still they retained their hold.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got him,&#8221; encouraged John. &#8220;Hold
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly Sam doubled up his legs, drawing both Grant and George
forward, almost on their faces. Then quick as a flash he shot out with
both feet, striking the two boys each full in the chest. Their grip was
torn loose and they were sent sprawling backward, over the seat onto
John, who too was bowled over so that all four boys lay in a heap on
the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>Grant was the first to regain his senses, and a strange sight
greeted his eyes. Sam and Petersen were now on their feet, still locked
in each other&#8217;s arms. Suddenly the Finn wrenched an arm free and
drawing back struck the negro a stunning blow squarely between the
eyes. Sam&#8217;s arms half dropped to his sides and he reeled
drunkenly. Then quick as a flash he once more seized his enemy in his
embrace and a moment later the two men went overboard.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='fss'>A SORRY
PLIGHT</span></h2>

<p>There was a great splash. The sturdy life-boat rocked dangerously
and then all was still.</p>

<p>John and George had now lifted themselves from their fallen position
and all three boys peered eagerly about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are they? What happened?&#8221; demanded John.</p>

<p>&#8220;They went overboard,&#8221; exclaimed Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;But where are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There they are, over there,&#8221; cried George. &#8220;Get
out the oars.&#8221;</p>

<p>A dark head appeared for an instant and then sank beneath the
surface of the water once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Sam,&#8221; cried John excitedly. &#8220;Swing
the boat around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m doing my best,&#8221; panted George as he dipped
one oar deep into the water and pulled with all his might. In response
to his efforts the boat came around until it was directly over the spot
where Sam&#8217;s head had appeared. John and Grant hung over the sides
ready to seize the negro the moment he was seen again.</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is,&#8221; cried Grant suddenly, and he made a lunge
at Sam, who had come to the surface for the second time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get him?&#8221; demanded John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Help me, somebody!&#8221;</p>

<p>John sprang to his assistance and a moment later the two boys
dragged the half-drowned negro over the side into the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Petersen?&#8221; demanded Grant, loosing his
hold on Sam and allowing him to sink to the bottom of the boat.
&#8220;Have you seen him, Pop?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said George, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve
looked everywhere for him, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fred had now recovered somewhat from the blow he had received and he
joined the others in their search for the missing sailor. The four boys
stood up in the boat and peered about them anxiously in every
direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure he didn&#8217;t come up, Pop?&#8221; asked
Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you I&#8217;ve been looking for him,&#8221; said
George. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen him at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he must have come up,&#8221; protested John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he did,&#8221; acknowledged George. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe it, though, for I&#8217;ve certainly been on the
lookout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; demanded John in dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can we do?&#8221; said George.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;ll drown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He probably has already,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;Think how
long he&#8217;s been under.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you mean to say we&#8217;ll never even find his
body?&#8221; said John, almost unnerved by the sudden catastrophe.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to look, anyway,&#8221; said Grant
decidedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose we row around in a circle for a while,&#8221; Fred
suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can try at least,&#8221; said Grant, and fitting the oars
into the oarlocks the four boys rowed slowly about, all the time
keeping a sharp lookout in all directions. Meanwhile Sam lay motionless
on the bottom of the boat. For at least half an hour the search was
continued, but not one glimpse of the missing Petersen did they
secure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s no use,&#8221; exclaimed Grant at
last.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess not,&#8221; agreed John. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do
us any good if we did find him now. He&#8217;s surely drowned by this
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt of it,&#8221; said Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;And there&#8217;s the fellow who did it,&#8221; exclaimed
George, pointing to Sam, who still lay huddled in a heap in the stern.
No one had paid the slightest attention to the negro since he had been
hauled aboard. He was exhausted, but in no danger, as could be plainly
seen from his regular and heavy breathing.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to throw him overboard, too,&#8221; said John.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not entirely to blame,&#8221; said Grant.
&#8220;He&#8217;s ignorant and superstitious and doesn&#8217;t know any
better, but we do, and we must act accordingly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He committed a crime, though,&#8221; said John, &#8220;and we
ought to hand him over to the authorities.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What authorities?&#8221; said Grant with a grim smile.
&#8220;Just look around you. There isn&#8217;t even a boat or a bit of
land in sight, let alone authorities.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we ought to punish him ourselves,&#8221; insisted
John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are we to do a thing like that!&#8221; said George.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve no right to take the law into our own
hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment Sam stirred and finally sat up. He was soaking wet
still and very weak. He blinked at the sun, which was now shining
brightly, and looked dazedly about him. The four boys watched him in
silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is I?&#8221; demanded Sam at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you think you are?&#8221; exclaimed John.
&#8220;You&#8217;re in a boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;De <i>Josephine</i>,&#8221; muttered Sam. &#8220;Where am de
<i>Josephine</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As though you didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; said John scornfully.
&#8220;You needn&#8217;t try to bluff us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What dat?&#8221; said Sam in a puzzled way. &#8220;What dat
you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said you knew just as well as we do where the
<i>Josephine</i> is,&#8221; said John, &#8220;and that you
needn&#8217;t try to bluff us, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>The black man looked straight at John as though he did not
understand a word that was said to him. His face was an absolute blank
and if he was acting, he certainly did it well. He glanced down at his
clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&#8217;s all wet,&#8221; he murmured to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you don&#8217;t remember jumping into this boat and
being out here all night,&#8221; exclaimed John skeptically, though he
was nettled by Sam&#8217;s appearance of innocence.</p>

<p>Sam merely looked at him and shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about your fight with&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep quiet, John,&#8221; said Grant sharply.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention that yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What dat?&#8221; asked Sam, looking curiously from one boy to
the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, Sam,&#8221; said Grant quickly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you remember the fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;De fire?&#8221; said Sam, completely mystified.
&#8220;Wha&#8217; fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the <i>Josephine</i>,&#8221; exclaimed John.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that she burned to the water&#8217;s
edge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah does remember dat fire now,&#8221; said Sam eagerly, a
gleam of understanding showing in his face. &#8220;She done come out ob
de hatchway, didn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It did,&#8221; agreed Grant. &#8220;After that don&#8217;t
you remember how we all jumped into the boats and rowed away?
Don&#8217;t you remember that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Deed Ah don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Sam. &#8220;Ah don&#8217;t
remembah a thing about dat ar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; demanded John sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sho&#8217; Ah is,&#8221; exclaimed Sam sincerely. It did not
seem to the four boys that he could be fooling, his manner seemed so
earnest.</p>

<p>For some moments no one on the little boat spoke a word. The boys
sat and looked at Sam, and he sat and looked at them and at the boat
and the boundless ocean stretching on every side as far as the eye
could see. Not a sign of life could be seen on it anywhere. There was
no trace of the other boats that had set out from the burning brig and
it was impossible to conjecture what had happened to them.</p>

<p>Finally Sam sighed deeply and he sank back against the stern of the
boat as though he was exhausted. His eyes half closed and he yawned
sleepily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&#8217;s tired,&#8221; he murmured, and straightway fell
asleep once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of it?&#8221; demanded John a moment
later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of what?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that Sam really doesn&#8217;t remember all that
happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s possible, all right,&#8221; said Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how could it be?&#8221; John insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; explained Grant. &#8220;Sam
was scared to death in that storm; you all know that. He was moaning
and groaning around the boat and when the fire started he might easily
have gone out of his head. Perhaps he was even stunned by the
lightning. Since that time he has been in a state of unconsciousness,
and now he doesn&#8217;t remember a thing that he did. Oh, I think
it&#8217;s perfectly possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly strange,&#8221; mused George.</p>

<p>&#8220;It surely is,&#8221; exclaimed John. &#8220;Still if he
wasn&#8217;t telling the truth he certainly is a fine actor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of such things happening before,&#8221;
remarked Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; said John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, people being in sort of a blank state when they do
things that they don&#8217;t remember at all later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What made Sam that way?&#8221; said John.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;He was so
frightened it probably drove him temporarily out of his head.
Unconsciously he blamed it all on poor Petersen so that when he saw him
right here in the same boat, his one idea was to get
revenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we blame him then?&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;If a man
doesn&#8217;t know what he is doing, is he responsible?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d hate to decide that,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;At
the same time I don&#8217;t see how we can hold it against him,
especially when he doesn&#8217;t know what it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When we get back to civilization we may have to tell on him
though,&#8221; remarked John. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we&#8217;ll
have to do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till we get there,&#8221; advised Grant. &#8220;From the
look of things right now, it doesn&#8217;t seem that we are going to
get there very soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny we don&#8217;t see any boats,&#8221; said
George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or land,&#8221; added John.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about some food?&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;We
haven&#8217;t eaten in a long time you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; Grant agreed. &#8220;We can eat
something anyway. Somebody open up the food, and the water
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ample provisions for several days were found to have been placed
aboard and the taste of food worked wonders with the unfortunate boys.
They were sparing of it, however, and even more careful of their water
supply. While in all probability they would be picked up before long by
some passing steamer, it was deemed advisable to go slowly. The rations
apportioned were divided into five equal parts, the four boys quickly
consuming their shares while Sam&#8217;s was kept out for him until he
should awaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t a good many steamers pass this way?&#8221; said
Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Grant grimly. &#8220;Where
are we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somewhere near the West Indies, I suppose,&#8221; said
Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps we are,&#8221; Grant agreed. &#8220;Personally I
don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we row?&#8221; suggested John.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use?&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;We
don&#8217;t know which way to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a compass, you know,&#8221; said George.</p>

<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t help us now, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; said
Grant. &#8220;If we knew where we were, it might.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in the tropics all right from the feeling of that
sun,&#8221; said John.</p>

<p>All day long the little party drifted idly about on the ocean. The
water was almost still, as there was hardly a breath of air stirring.
Not a sail appeared to break the monotony of the scene and the boys
began to feel worried. The sun was scorching and they had no protection
at all. Finally, night came with a welcome fall in temperature, but
otherwise they were not one whit better off. They seemed just as far
from rescue as ever.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='fss'>IN SEARCH OF
LAND</span></h2>

<p>When next the sun rose it shone upon a very disconsolate and
discouraged little band. The four boys and their negro companion were
becoming very downhearted. Thus far they had not seen a sign of a boat.
It almost seemed as if they were on a desert ocean, for in these days
of world-wide commerce there are few nooks and crannies of the seven
seas not visited by the merchant fleets.</p>

<p>Sam was the most cheerful person on board. Food and sleep had
restored his spirits wonderfully and with the characteristic trait of
his race, he was almost satisfied as long as he had those two things.
No one had mentioned his fight with Petersen to him. If he did not
remember it, there was no use in telling him about it. The four boys
decided to watch him closely, however, in case he was acting a part. If
such was the case he would surely betray himself sooner or later.</p>

<p>The sun was just a little way above the horizon and a scanty
breakfast was being served on board the boat. John had just arisen from
his seat to help himself to a big sailor-cracker. He turned and glanced
at the newly risen sun and suddenly stopped short, the cracker half way
to his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, String?&#8221; demanded Fred,
noticing his friend&#8217;s action.</p>

<p>&#8220;Land!&#8221; cried John, excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; exclaimed the others in one breath, at the same
time springing to their feet utterly regardless of whether the boat
upset or not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right over there,&#8221; said John, pointing. &#8220;I see
hills and palm trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; exclaimed George a moment later.
&#8220;You&#8217;re dreaming, String.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not,&#8221; said John insistently. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
any of you fellows see it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mirage,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t see anything, String.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mirage, nothing!&#8221; cried John hotly. &#8220;I see land
and if you all weren&#8217;t so stupid you&#8217;d see it
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you can see it because you are so much taller than we
are,&#8221; suggested Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand up on one of the seats then,&#8221; said John.
&#8220;That&#8217;ll make you as tall as I.&#8221;</p>

<p>George quickly followed this advice, but he could see no land.
Grant, too, tried it but he was no more successful. They all began to
make fun of John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something has gone to your head, String,&#8221; teased
George. &#8220;You&#8217;re seeing things.&#8221;</p>

<p>John, however, was so angry by this time that he would not pay the
slightest attention to such remarks. His face was flushed and he still
stared sullenly out across the water in the direction of the rising
sun. Suddenly his jaw dropped, and a look of amazement spread itself
over his features. His eyes were round with surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone,&#8221; he exclaimed in consternation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha,&#8221; laughed George, derisively. &#8220;I told you
it was a mirage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps, the wind blew it away,&#8221; suggested Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;You all think you&#8217;re pretty smart,&#8221; said John, a
half-foolish grin on his face. &#8220;I swear I thought I saw land over
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I tell you what we do,&#8221; suggested Grant.
&#8220;String thought he saw land over in that direction, but
it&#8217;s gone now. Just the same I say we row that way and see what
we can see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the point in that?&#8221; demanded Fred.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t really think he saw anything, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t. At the same time we can&#8217;t be any
worse off than we are now, and String&#8217;s seeing the mirage may
have been an omen. Perhaps there is land somewhere over there after
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing,&#8221; agreed George. &#8220;What do you
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s try it,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;As Grant
says we can&#8217;t be any worse off than we are now. Perhaps
we&#8217;ll be better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah think dat&#8217;s a fine idea,&#8221; said Sam
enthusiastically. &#8220;Ah can row, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you steer,&#8221; directed Grant. &#8220;Give me your
compass, Pop, and set a course for him. You follow it exactly,
Sam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah sho&#8217; will,&#8221; agreed Sam, delighted at the idea
of having no work to do and the responsibility of steering the
boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;m not a pretty handy sort of a fellow to have
around,&#8221; George remarked with a grin as he took the compass from
around his neck and handed it to Sam. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t written in
my diary lately, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you still got that with you, Pop?&#8221; exclaimed
John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely. You don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d lose that, do
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you might in all this mixup.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; said George warmly. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t lose my diary for anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give Sam the course to steer,&#8221; exclaimed Grant.
&#8220;You all talk so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; laughed George, and setting the compass on
the bottom of the boat between the negro&#8217;s feet he directed him
to steer a little south of east. This was the direction in which John
had seen his phantom island.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a plan,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;I say we all row
steadily for an hour without looking around. At the end of that time
we&#8217;ll all stand up and I feel sure we&#8217;ll see land not far
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you going to tell when the hour is up?&#8221;
inquired John. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t a watch in the whole crowd that
will run. I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s too warm for even the sun to be
on time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll have to guess at it. Is everybody
agreeable?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose a boat appears ahead of us,&#8221; suggested George.
&#8220;We might never see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sam is facing that way,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;He will see
it and can tell us. Unless he sees a boat, though, he is not to say a
word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a go,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;Is everybody
ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>The word was given and the life-boat shot forward on its course. The
game being played served to cheer up the members of the little party
and as a matter of fact no one had remained greatly worried about their
condition for any length of time. Youth is always hopeful and every one
on board had always had the feeling deep in his heart that they would
be rescued before long. Lack of food and water had not assailed them as
yet.</p>

<p>&#8220;The hour must be nearly up,&#8221; remarked George at
last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh,&#8221; snorted Fred. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
we&#8217;ve been going over twenty minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not an hour,&#8221; agreed Grant. &#8220;Stick to
it a while longer, Pop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; sighed George, &#8220;but I know
we&#8217;ve been working at least an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never worked an hour in your life,&#8221; said John.
&#8220;How do you know how long it is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I warn you not to talk like that,&#8221; said George,
pretending to be angry. &#8220;I am sitting right behind you, you know,
and it would be no trouble at all for me to give you a good, swift
punch in the middle of the spine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Pop,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;How bloodthirsty
you&#8217;re getting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thirsty for a drink of water, that&#8217;s
sure,&#8221; exclaimed George.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to wait until the hour is up,&#8221; said
Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say it&#8217;s up now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The rest of us say not, though,&#8221; reminded Grant.
&#8220;Besides that, we&#8217;re three to your one, so we can make you
do pretty much as we please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; exclaimed George haughtily. &#8220;Well,
if I want to turn my head around I don&#8217;t know who could stop
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try it,&#8221; warned Fred, who pulled the bow
oar. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about Fred up there?&#8221; demanded John.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve all got our backs turned to him and he may look
around every minute for all we know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sam can see him,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;Has he looked
around yet, Sam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah ain&#8217;t seen him if he has,&#8221; replied Sam,
grinning from ear to ear and showing a double row of ivory teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he does, you just tell us,&#8221; said Grant, &#8220;and
we&#8217;ll fix him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sah,&#8221; grinned Sam. &#8220;Ah&#8217;ll report all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seen any boats yet, Sam?&#8221; demanded George.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Sam before Grant could stop him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Pop,&#8221; exclaimed Grant hotly, &#8220;you
ought not to have asked him that question. We made an agreement not to
look around, but what&#8217;s the use if you aren&#8217;t going to live
up to it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I look around?&#8221; demanded George.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s all I agreed to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, but&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seen any land, Sam?&#8221; asked George. He knew how angry he
was making Grant, but one of his main objects in life was to tease
people.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah ain&#8217;t sayin&#8217;,&#8221; said Sam warily.
&#8220;Yo&#8217; all ain&#8217;t gwine to ketch me nappin&#8217;
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Sam,&#8221; exclaimed Grant;
&#8220;don&#8217;t you answer a single question that any one asks
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Grant,&#8221; mocked George, at the same time pitching
his voice like a girl&#8217;s. &#8220;I think you&#8217;re just
horrid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit him, somebody!&#8221; exclaimed Fred laughingly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him live.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment, however, George, who had been paying more attention
to the conversation than the rowing, caught a crab. He lost his balance
completely and toppled over backward, sprawling at full length on the
bottom of the boat. As a consequence the whole crew was disorganized.
The agreement not to look around was entirely forgotten and all heads
were turned to look at George.</p>

<p>Suddenly John stood up in the boat and cheered at the top of his
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look there!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;There&#8217;s land this
time, all right!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span
class='fss'>ASHORE</span></h2>

<p>All eyes were immediately turned in the direction in which John
pointed. Sure enough, and every one saw it this time, land appeared far
off on the distant horizon. It could be seen only faintly, but there
was no mistaking it. The low-lying shore and the outline of a few hills
were plainly visible.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of that?&#8221; exclaimed Grant joyously.
&#8220;It certainly looks as if our luck had turned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sho&#8217; it has,&#8221; said Sam readily. &#8220;Soon as we
lef&#8217; dat hard luck Finn Ah knowed we&#8217;d be all right. Ah
suttinly is glad Ah is not in de same boat wid him.&#8221;</p>

<p>These words of Sam threw a sudden damper upon every one in the boat.
The four boys looked at one another in consternation and much of their
joy at the sight of land was taken away by the recollection of the
tragic end of their shipmate Petersen. Sam, however, seemed entirely
unconscious of having said anything out of the way. His face was
wreathed in smiles and showed nothing but satisfaction, now that he was
separated from Petersen. If any doubt had still lingered in the
boys&#8217; minds as to Sam&#8217;s sincerity that doubt was now
dispelled. There was no question at all that the negro recalled nothing
of his tragic deed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s de mattah wid you gentlemen?&#8221; demanded
Sam, noticing the strange behavior of the four young sailors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing at all,&#8221; said Grant quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s row for shore,&#8221; exclaimed John, doing his
best to change the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I say,&#8221; agreed George, who had now
picked himself up and had taken hold of his oar once again. &#8220;I
want to feel some good old earth under my feet for a change.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;Let&#8217;s not
waste any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>They dug their oars into the water and with renewed energy set out
for the distant shore. Now and again they turned around and looked
ahead in an effort to discover the character of the land they were
approaching. It was still far away, however, and not much idea could be
had of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an island all right,&#8221; said John
confidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably,&#8221; agreed Grant. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we
were very near the mainland when the <i>Josephine</i>
burned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look there,&#8221; cried Fred all at once. &#8220;Look back
of the boat there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every one immediately stopped rowing and craned his neck to see what
Fred was pointing out.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Fred?&#8221; demanded George. &#8220;What do you
see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that fin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat Finn!&#8221; exclaimed Sam. &#8220;Where dat
Finn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the one you mean,&#8221; said Fred, smiling in spite of
his evident excitement. &#8220;I mean the fin of a fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see it,&#8221; cried John suddenly. &#8220;What is
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it,&#8221; repeated Fred. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A shark?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it is,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;It must be a
whopper, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every one else saw the fin now and involuntarily a shiver passed
over most of those on the little boat. The great black fin sailed
easily and steadily along, just cutting the top of the water. Gruesome
and forbidding it looked and straightway recalled to the minds of the
four boys the stories they had so often heard of the hordes of
man-eating sharks that infested the waters of the West Indies.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another,&#8221; cried Grant suddenly.</p>

<p>Sure enough another fin joined the first and one ahead of the other
the sharks cruised around the waters near the life-boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zowie!&#8221; exclaimed George. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;m glad
I&#8217;m not in the water just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; said Fred thankfully. &#8220;I wonder what
they&#8217;d do to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not curious enough to find out,&#8221; said
George grimly. &#8220;They can&#8217;t touch us here in the boat,
anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true enough,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;I say we
don&#8217;t waste any more time looking at them, either. Personally,
I&#8217;d rather be ashore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more the oars were dipped into the water and the voyage was
continued. The sharks also came along and their fins could be seen
first on one side of the boat and then on the other; sometimes they
appeared in front and sometimes astern. Relentlessly they followed,
however, all the way to the shore.</p>

<p>As the boat came nearer the land the boys got more of an idea of the
place they were approaching.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any houses,&#8221; remarked John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; agreed Fred. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look as if
there was a human being on the island. It looks fertile enough,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll know all about it before long,&#8221; said
Grant. &#8220;Where shall we land?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with that little harbor straight
ahead?&#8221; said Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;Steer us in there,
Sam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter what kind of a place it is I&#8217;ll certainly be
glad to get on shore again,&#8221; said George eagerly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve had about all I want of boats for a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with you, Pop,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
had enough, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we&#8217;d see a steamer,&#8221; sighed John.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish a steamer would see us,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;I
think that would be more to the point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve simply got to be picked up soon,&#8221; said
John. &#8220;Our food won&#8217;t last a great many days
longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good for a week, anyway,&#8221; said Fred.
&#8220;Some one will surely find us by that time. We can hoist a flag
on top of that hill up there. A passing steamer would be sure to see
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There may be people on the island for all we know,&#8221;
said Grant. &#8220;We can&#8217;t see it all from here and it must be
at least a mile long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll know soon, anyway,&#8221; exclaimed John.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t run us onto any rocks on the way in, Sam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sah,&#8221; grinned Sam. &#8220;Jes&#8217; leave dat to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shore of the island was low and sandy. Wide white beaches ran
down to the water&#8217;s edge, while a short distance back were many
palms and other trees of which the boys did not know the names. As Fred
remarked, the island certainly looked fertile. Great excitement filled
the breasts of every member of the party as they neared the shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sharks have gone,&#8221; exclaimed John suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure enough,&#8221; said George. &#8220;I had forgotten all
about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There they are out there,&#8221; said Grant indicating a spot
some fifty yards astern of the boat. &#8220;They&#8217;re not alone,
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten or a dozen great fins could be seen weaving in and out in the
place Grant had indicated.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be shallow in here,&#8221; remarked Fred.
&#8220;That&#8217;s probably why they don&#8217;t come in any closer.
Look out for going aground, Sam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not de leas&#8217; dangah of dat,&#8221; replied Sam
confidently and whether he knew what he was talking about or not, the
fact remains that a few moments later the bow of the boat grounded
softly on the white sand, only a few feet from the shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;First ashore,&#8221; cried George leaping overboard and
dashing up on the beach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, there! Wait a minute,&#8221; shouted Grant.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to pull this boat up and we&#8217;ll need
everyone&#8217;s help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better take the provisions out,&#8221; said Fred a
moment later when they had hauled the boat some distance up on the
shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; demanded George who was always opposed to
doing any more work than was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put them somewhere in the shade I say,&#8221; exclaimed Fred.
&#8220;Take out that cask of water, too. Those things have been
broiling in the sun too long already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s take everything out except the oars,&#8221; said
Grant. &#8220;We&#8217;ll probably be here for a couple of days and we
might as well do it now as any time. I don&#8217;t believe we&#8217;ll
be picked up before then; at least there is a good chance that we
won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed George. &#8220;Take everything out
then. As soon as that&#8217;s done though, I&#8217;m going to see what
the other side of this island looks like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We all will,&#8221; said John. &#8220;Let&#8217;s do this
first though.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all fell to work with a will and soon had the the boat
unloaded. The contents were placed under a sheltering grove of mangrove
trees a short distance away. The boat was hauled a little farther up on
shore and then the boys prepared to start on their tour of inspection.
Sam followed as a matter of course.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, this is a pretty fine island,&#8221; exclaimed George as
they started out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pineapples,&#8221; cried Grant, excitedly. &#8220;What do you
think of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they ripe?&#8221; demanded George as the little band
swooped down upon the cluster of plants.</p>

<p>&#8220;They certainly are,&#8221; said Grant, who quickly produced
his jackknife and cut off the top of one of the pineapples.
&#8220;Watch me eat it,&#8221; and he began to eat the juicy fruit with
great relish. He was not far ahead of the others, however, for soon
they were all busily engaged in the same way.</p>

<p>At last they had their fill of pineapples and moved on. Banana trees
were discovered, standing in rows as if they had been planted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody lives on this island, or used to anyway,&#8221;
remarked Grant. &#8220;Those trees never grew wild like
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said John. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look
as though they&#8217;d been cultivated lately though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find out before long anyway,&#8221; said Fred.
&#8220;If there are people here all I hope is that they&#8217;re not
cannibals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey no cannibals heah,&#8221; said Sam so seriously that
every one laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not, Sam,&#8221; said Fred, smiling. &#8220;I&#8217;d
hate to be eaten.&#8221;</p>

<p>They crossed the island which was not more than a half-mile wide at
this point, and that seemed to be the average most of the way. The view
was the same as on the opposite side; not a thing to be seen but the
boundless ocean with not a speck of a sail or a bit of land within
sight. It was a little kingdom all of its own. A quarter of a mile from
shore the low rollers broke ceaselessly on a coral reef, while
overhead, the gulls swept around and around, their plaintive whistle
being very distinct at times.</p>

<p>In silence the boys stood and gazed at the ocean.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks as if we were alone in the world, doesn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; said Fred at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;It surely does,&#8221; said George. &#8220;I somehow feel as
if there ought to be some sort of a big black king sitting under one of
these palm trees with about twenty slaves standing around fanning
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Speaking of black,&#8221; remarked John. &#8220;What has
happened to Sam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He went back to the boat,&#8221; said Fred, but as he spoke
Sam suddenly appeared, running towards the little group at full speed.
That he was greatly excited about something could be plainly seen from
his manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Sam?&#8221; demanded Grant as the erstwhile cook
came puffing and blowing up to the spot where the four boys stood.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;De boat,&#8221; gasped Sam. &#8220;De boat am
gone.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='fss'>A SERIOUS
MISHAP</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;The boat gone!&#8221; exclaimed Grant in amazement.
&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What Ah say is dat de boat am gone, dat&#8217;s all,&#8221;
said Sam.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could it get away though?&#8221; demanded John excitedly.
&#8220;Who is there to take it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah don&#8217;t know, sah,&#8221; said Sam. &#8220;It
sho&#8217; is gone though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be some one on the island then,&#8221; exclaimed
John. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how it could disappear any other
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; admitted Grant. &#8220;It certainly is
queer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The four boys stood amazed, too surprised by this sudden catastrophe
at first to do anything. It seemed almost impossible to think that such
a thing could be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure you went to the right place, Sam?&#8221;
demanded Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sho&#8217; Ah is,&#8221; said Sam. &#8220;Dey is no doubt ob
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s all go and have a look,&#8221; George
suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first sensible idea yet, Pop,&#8221; exclaimed Grant.
&#8220;Come on, everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helter skelter and making as fast time as they could, the little
party set out to retrace their steps to their landing place. Fear
filled their hearts, not only on account of the disappearance of their
boat, but also because there was the chance that some one else was on
the island who might have stolen it. Not that the boys would not have
been glad to see other people, but because they feared that the
strangers might turn out to be enemies. Certainly, if they were
friends, it seemed queer they should steal the boat.</p>

<p>It was not long before they came to the little harbor. Grant was the
first to reach the water&#8217;s edge and he looked about him eagerly,
for traces of the missing boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s where it was,&#8221; exclaimed Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t even a mark on the beach where it was
pulled up,&#8221; said John. &#8220;That&#8217;s a queer thing it seems
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure this is the spot?&#8221; said Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it is,&#8221; said George, confidently. &#8220;There
is no doubt of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See any footprints around?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;None at all,&#8221; replied John. &#8220;What do you think of
it all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think, Grant?&#8221; inquired George. Grant was
always the one to whom the other boys turned when there was any
question to be settled.</p>

<p>Grant stood on the beach and gazed fixedly out to sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you looking at?&#8221; demanded John.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking at our boat,&#8221; replied Grant
quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;Where is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right out there,&#8221; said Grant, pointing to a white speck
that could be faintly seen far out on the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how did it get there?&#8221; insisted Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;It floated,&#8221; said Grant quietly, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll
tell you how. You know we pulled it up on the shore, but I&#8217;m
afraid we didn&#8217;t pull it far enough. While we were away, the tide
must have come in and floated it off. There it goes, and here we stay,
I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so sure of that,&#8221; exclaimed George, and
he began to divest himself of his few remaining clothes as rapidly as
possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think you&#8217;re going to do, Pop?&#8221;
demanded Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going after that boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By swimming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. How else could I reach it?&#8221; and by this time
George was almost stripped to his skin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly, Pop,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;That
boat is at least a half-mile from shore and you couldn&#8217;t possibly
catch it. It&#8217;s getting farther away all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worth a try, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; demanded
George. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to stay here the rest of your life,
do you?&#8221; He was a splendid swimmer and had won many prizes in
this line of sport. At the same time what he proposed to attempt now
was most ambitious.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re crazy, Pop,&#8221; said Grant earnestly.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t possibly make it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you that later,&#8221; said George doggedly,
and he made as if to start down the beach. John, however, seized him
and held him firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t try it,&#8221; he begged.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll only drown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go,&#8221; exclaimed George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think ob dem sha&#8217;ks,&#8221; said Sam. &#8220;Dey&#8217;s
millions ob dem out dar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Pop,&#8221; cried Grant. &#8220;Think of
those sharks. Even if you could swim that far the sharks would get
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put your clothes on again,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;We need
you worse than we do the boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The argument about the sharks had more influence on George than
anything else. He did not mind the ocean, but the thought of its hungry
inhabitants was too much for him. He yielded to the pleas of his
comrades and slowly began to put on his clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll we do?&#8221; he said dazedly. &#8220;It looks
as if we were stranded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we are,&#8221; agreed Grant grimly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to sit here and wait until some steamer happens
by and picks us up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how will any one know we&#8217;re here?&#8221; said
George.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll hoist a flag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, but where are we going to get a
flag?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you,&#8221; exclaimed Grant, and he made his
way to the spot where their stores and provisions were piled. A moment
later he returned with the canvas tarpaulin that had been used as a
cover. &#8220;Here&#8217;s our flag,&#8221; he said, waving the heavy
piece of canvas around his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too heavy,&#8221; objected John. &#8220;It would
take a gale to make that stand out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is heavy,&#8221; admitted Grant. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
of anything else we can use though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except my shirt,&#8221; said George quickly.
&#8220;That&#8217;ll make a real flag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what will you wear?&#8221; said John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing maybe,&#8221; replied George, cheerfully. &#8220;In
this climate I don&#8217;t believe any one would suffer much from lack
of clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably not,&#8221; Grant agreed. &#8220;Why use your shirt
in preference to any one else&#8217;s though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I offer it first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; laughed Grant. &#8220;Pass it
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>George handed his shirt to Grant and soon the seams were ripped so
that it covered the largest amount of possible space. &#8220;Now for a
flag-pole,&#8221; exclaimed Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll attend to that,&#8221; exclaimed Fred and he
straightway fell upon a nearby tree with his jackknife. He cut off one
of the longest and straightest branches after considerable trouble, and
presented it for his companions&#8217; approval. &#8220;How&#8217;s
that?&#8221; he demanded proudly. &#8220;It&#8217;s about thirty feet
long and stuck up on top of that hill, it could be seen for a long,
long distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll now go up and raise the flag,&#8221; cried Grant,
and leading the way he set out for the top of the hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at the brook,&#8221; exclaimed John suddenly, after they
had covered about half the distance to their destination.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a very big one,&#8221; remarked George as he
stepped across the tiny stream. &#8220;I wonder where it comes
from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can follow it and see,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;If the
water is good to drink, we are in luck, for we may need it desperately
before long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks clear enough,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
taste of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till we find the source,&#8221; advised Grant. &#8220;We
can tell better then whether it is good or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>They soon discovered the origin of the little stream. Set in among a
grove of scrub palmetto trees was a spring. The water bubbled merrily
out into a little pool, the bottom of which was covered with shining
white pebbles.</p>

<p>&#8220;That looks all right to me,&#8221; exclaimed Fred eagerly and
a moment later he was flat on his stomach, taking long draughts of the
clear water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew, that&#8217;s fine,&#8221; he said enthusiastically, as
he rose to his feet once more and sighed with satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it cool?&#8221; asked John.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost cold,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;Why
don&#8217;t you try it?&#8221;</p>

<p>John did try it and so did every one else. All pronounced it to be
just as Fred had described it. &#8220;We can live for a long while on
that water and the fruit that&#8217;s here,&#8221; remarked Fred.
&#8220;We won&#8217;t have to worry about starving anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same we want to get our flag up,&#8221; exclaimed
Grant. &#8220;Let&#8217;s do it now and get it over with.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without further delay they proceeded to the top of the hill. There
were no trees on the summit and for a space of two or three hundred
yards, the ground was bare and unobstructed. The very highest point on
the island was selected and there a hole was dug. Sticks and knives and
fingers and anything that could be found was used in the task, for no
tools had been put in the life-boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we only had the oars,&#8221; said George, &#8220;we could
have tied them all together and made a real flag pole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with this?&#8221; demanded Fred.
&#8220;It may not be very beautiful, but it&#8217;ll do the work all
right. It&#8217;s limber too, so that if a high wind comes up it will
bend and not break.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; exclaimed George, &#8220;put the flag on
and we&#8217;ll set it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sleeves were torn from George&#8217;s sacrificed shirt. The
sleeves in turn were torn into strips and with these the rest of the
shirt, or rather the flag, was tied securely to the pole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoist it up,&#8221; cried George. &#8220;I must say I never
expected to have my shirt used for a flag on some deserted island
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes a good one all right,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;That
ought to be visible for a good long distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose any one would take the trouble to investigate
if he did see it?&#8221; inquired John skeptically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any one would certainly investigate a flag like that,&#8221;
laughed George. &#8220;They&#8217;d think it was a Chinese laundry or
something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe they&#8217;ll take it for a pirate flag,&#8221;
suggested Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;This island looks like a good place for pirates all
right,&#8221; remarked John.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='fss'>A NEW
HOME</span></h2>

<p>That night the shipwrecked little band slept out in the open with
nothing but the stars over their heads. In fact they had no other
shelter, but the night was mild and clear and no one suffered any
discomfort.</p>

<p>Thus far the boys had had no chance to explore their new home, but
the first thing the next morning they determined to do so. A plunge in
the waters of the little bay put every one in good humor. No one went
very far out, however, for in spite of the fact that they knew there
was slight chance of any shark venturing anywhere so near the shore,
the knowledge that the giants were lurking not far away cured every
desire to swim out any distance.</p>

<p>Sam decided he would not join the exploring party. He had an idea
that he would be very much better off, dozing in the sun at the foot of
some palm tree. The four boys separated, Fred and Grant going together,
and John and George pairing off.</p>

<p>&#8220;You two go one way,&#8221; directed Grant, &#8220;and
we&#8217;ll go the other. If we follow the shore we&#8217;ll meet
around on the other side of the island somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed John. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see you
later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After we see what the shore of the island is like, I say we
explore the interior,&#8221; said George, as he and John walked off
down the beach.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I say,&#8221; exclaimed John. &#8220;That
part looks more interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does to me, too. There are lots of birds here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know the names of them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t. All I know is that they are certainly
beautiful. Look at that one there,&#8221; exclaimed George suddenly, as
there was a flash of scarlet showing for an instant among the trees to
their left.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if there are any parrots here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like to have one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly would. I&#8217;d like to take it home with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we ever get there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we&#8217;ll get there,&#8221; said John
confidently. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about that for a second.
It&#8217;s only a question of how soon it will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so sure about that, String. We don&#8217;t
know where we are and it certainly seems queer that we haven&#8217;t
seen a single boat. That&#8217;s what worries me. If many boats went by
this way, I wouldn&#8217;t worry, but if no boats come along, how are
we to be picked up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But some will come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me we ought to have a lookout,&#8221; said John.
&#8220;A boat might go right by and we&#8217;d never see it at
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said George. &#8220;I think we ought to
take turns up on top of the hill where the flag is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing. We&#8217;ll talk about it to Grant and
Fred, when we meet them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at that rock,&#8221; exclaimed George suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at its shape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is queer,&#8221; admitted John. &#8220;It looks like a
fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it? Maybe it&#8217;s a petrified
shark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess not that,&#8221; laughed John. &#8220;Still it is
shaped more like a shark than anything else, isn&#8217;t it?
Isn&#8217;t it queer?&#8221;</p>

<p>The odd shaped rock made a great impression on the two boys, and it
was a queer freak of nature. Black in color and about thirty feet long
the great bowlder stood out as a remarkable evidence of nature&#8217;s
handiwork. It lay in a small opening in the midst of a grove of palm
trees. The two boys drew near to investigate more closely and were
amazed at the smoothness of its surface and the way it glistened in the
sunlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is certainly strange,&#8221; exclaimed George. &#8220;It
looks as if it might have been under water for hundreds of years and
was worn smooth this way by the waves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so different from the other rocks, too,&#8221;
said John. &#8220;I wonder what made it black this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you notice,&#8221; remarked George, &#8220;that it
doesn&#8217;t look so much like a shark when you are close to it? When
we first saw it, it certainly did though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t it? Let&#8217;s go back to that spot
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>They retraced their steps and once more viewed the odd shaped rock
from the place where they had first caught sight of it. More than ever
were they impressed by its weird resemblance to a giant shark.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll certainly have to tell Grant and Fred about
this,&#8221; said John. &#8220;We&#8217;ll bring them down here to look
at it too.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two friends resumed their walk along the shore and before many
moments had passed they caught sight of Fred and Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think they&#8217;re looking at?&#8221; exclaimed
George.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Pop,&#8221; returned John. &#8220;They
certainly seem interested in something though, don&#8217;t
they?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fred and Grant were lying face downward on a rock which overhung the
water. Their gaze and attention seemed riveted on what they saw below
them, so that they did not even hear their friends approach.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you two looking at?&#8221; demanded George
curiously.</p>

<p>Grant looked up at the sound of his comrade&#8217;s voice but he did
not answer. He merely beckoned with one finger and then pointed to the
water below. John and George were not long in taking their places
alongside the other two and soon they were just as engrossed in what
they saw as were their companions.</p>

<p>The water was deep right up to the shore. It was also as clear as
crystal so that everything in it could be seen with remarkable
distinctness. Sand was mixed with coral on the bottom and the water was
populated with fish, and such strange fish too. All sizes, shapes and
colors they were; some almost flat with strange little pig-like mouths;
others chunky and with flat backs as though some one had hammered them
out. All of them, however, were wonderfully provided with marvelous
coloring, some of them with shades that changed from time to time. A
brilliant green ray, shaped like an eel, lay coiled about a piece of
coral; he opened his mouth with its wicked looking teeth and sucked in
the water which he could be seen to expel a moment later from his
gills.</p>

<p>For a long time the four boys lay and watched these things in
silence. It was like a fairy story to see all these strange inhabitants
of the tropic seas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew,&#8221; sighed Fred at length, &#8220;that&#8217;s a
wonderful sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say so,&#8221; exclaimed John heartily. &#8220;This
is a wonderful island too. I am almost glad we were stranded
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be too,&#8221; said George, &#8220;if I was only
certain we were going to get off all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess what Fred and I found this morning,&#8221; said
Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t any more wonderful than what Pop and I
saw,&#8221; retorted John.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you see?&#8221; demanded Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;A rock that&#8217;s shaped just like a shark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh,&#8221; snorted Fred. &#8220;That&#8217;s not half as
good as what we found.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us what it was then,&#8221; said George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tracks,&#8221; said Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tracks. What kind of tracks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you guess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not railroad?&#8221; suggested George and he put up his arm
as though he expected to have to ward off a blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly, Pop,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;Of
course they weren&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Man tracks?&#8221; queried John.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;They were goat
tracks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that right?&#8221; exclaimed George. &#8220;Did you see
any goats?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but we saw a good many tracks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you this was a wonderful island,&#8221; said John
heartily. &#8220;You see we&#8217;ve even got a herd of goats
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what good they&#8217;ll do us
though,&#8221; said Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; demanded John. &#8220;If we can catch one we
can have it to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Fred, &#8220;but how are
you going to cook it without fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll build one of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Without matches?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pop has some matches. Haven&#8217;t you, Pop?&#8221; inquired
John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, certainly,&#8221; said George with a great air of
importance. &#8220;I have everything of that kind. Wasn&#8217;t I the
fellow who had the compass too? I keep a diary and I have a compass and
I have some matches in a waterproof box. Who says that I&#8217;m not a
good man to have on any party?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re a fine fellow all right,&#8221; laughed
Grant. &#8220;Personally I don&#8217;t know what good your compass will
do us though. Your matches are all right and I advise you to be very
careful with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave that to me,&#8221; said George. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be
careful all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s going to catch these goats?&#8221; demanded
Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t gotten as far as that yet,&#8221; said Grant
laughingly. &#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll have to put salt on their
tails.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; exclaimed John seriously.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll make spears and get them that way. To-morrow
we&#8217;ll have a goat hunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we will,&#8221; said George skeptically. &#8220;Just at
present though, I say we do a little more exploring. We haven&#8217;t
seen much of the interior of the island yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along then,&#8221; cried Grant. &#8220;We&#8217;ll all
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>With Grant in the lead, they started. Every moment added to the new
delights the little island afforded. The tropical foliage was brilliant
and the bird-life seemed endless in its variety. The sides of the small
hill which the exploring party was ascending, however, were rocky and
when they were about halfway up, Grant suddenly stopped short in
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look there,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
cave.&#8221;</p>

<p>A dark opening in the rocks showed just ahead and there was a mad
race to see which boy should arrive at the spot first. It was a steep
ascent, but just in front of the cave was a flat ledge of rocks some
ten or fifteen feet wide which made a sort of front yard.</p>

<p>Grant was the first to reach the entrance and even before he looked
into the cave he stopped and picked up two objects from the ground at
his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you got?&#8221; demanded John.</p>

<p>Grant held the two articles in question up to view. &#8220;An old
flint-lock pistol and a powder-horn,&#8221; he said.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='fss'>AN IRON
CHEST</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; exclaimed George, &#8220;where do you suppose
they came from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody dropped them here, I suppose,&#8221; said Grant
dryly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said George, ignoring his friend&#8217;s
sarcasm, &#8220;but who was it? It must have been a long time ago
though. See how that pistol is all rusted and eaten away. I don&#8217;t
believe they&#8217;ve used that kind of a pistol in two hundred years,
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, John said this island looked like a good one for
pirates,&#8221; remarked Fred. &#8220;Maybe pirates left these things
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose so?&#8221; exclaimed George eagerly. &#8220;If
there were pirates here do you think they could have buried any
treasure on the island?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; laughed Grant.
&#8220;Even if they did, I don&#8217;t see just how it would do us any
good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we look for it?&#8221; demanded George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where shall we look?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe they left directions as to where it was
buried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; exclaimed John, &#8220;speaking of directions,
what happened to that code we were looking at on board the
<i>Josephine</i>? I suppose it burned up with the ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no it didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;It went
right into my hip pocket and that&#8217;s where it has been ever since
and where it is right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you decipher it, Grant?&#8221; said Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Grant grimly, &#8220;why don&#8217;t I?
It&#8217;s so easy you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it can be done,&#8221; insisted Fred firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it can,&#8221; laughed George. &#8220;The only
trouble is we don&#8217;t know how.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t even know it is a code,&#8221; said Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Petersen said it was,&#8221; Fred objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said Grant, &#8220;but he wasn&#8217;t sure
of it. That was only his opinion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t the water and everything hurt it?&#8221; asked
George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit. Here it is; you can see for yourself,&#8221; and
Grant produced the piece of parchment from his pocket. He unfolded it
while his three companions crowded eagerly around him to inspect the
strange document once again. No light was thrown on its secret, if it
had one, however, and the same baffling maze of numbers confronted the
boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put it away,&#8221; cried John impatiently. &#8220;I think
it&#8217;s a combination to a safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t either,&#8221; said Fred.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a code I tell you and I think that some one of us
ought to be able to read it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What good would it do if you did?&#8221; demanded John.
&#8220;Certainly it can&#8217;t apply to this island, and I say we
forget it and inspect this cave now. That is much more to the
point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put it away, Grant,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;To-morrow
though, I&#8217;m going to get to work on it and see if I can&#8217;t
make something out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help you,&#8221; said Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way,&#8221; cried Fred enthusiastically.
&#8220;Grant and I will find the money and Pop and String won&#8217;t
get a cent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; exclaimed George. &#8220;Well, if you can
find any money and not give me my share you&#8217;re a much better man
than I think you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not fight about the money just now,&#8221;
advised Grant. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t found it yet, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; exclaimed John. &#8220;I never heard such a
lot of crazy talk before either. Who&#8217;s coming into the
cave?&#8221;</p>

<p>The entrance was about ten feet wide and was high enough so that
even John could walk in without stooping. Far down towards the back of
the cave a patch of light shone on the floor showing that somewhere
else besides the spot where the boys stood, there was an opening.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see very well,&#8221; said Fred as they stepped
into the cave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither can I,&#8221; George agreed. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
very anxious to go walking around in strange dark caves
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can hurt you?&#8221; demanded John. &#8220;There
isn&#8217;t another soul on the island besides ourselves and
Sam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be,&#8221; admitted George. &#8220;Still there may
be holes in the floor or some kind of animals living here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going down to where that spot of light
is,&#8221; said John. &#8220;Is any one coming with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll go all right,&#8221; exclaimed George quickly.
&#8220;All I said was that I didn&#8217;t like it much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go slow,&#8221; cautioned Grant. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want
to run any risks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see better now than I could,&#8221; said John who was
in the lead. &#8220;My eyes are becoming more used to the dim
light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So are mine,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;The floor looks
perfectly flat to me too, and I think I see a box or something up ahead
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you do,&#8221; John agreed. &#8220;I see something
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>They proceeded cautiously on their way until they came to the box in
question.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a chest,&#8221; exclaimed John, bending over.
&#8220;It&#8217;s iron, too,&#8221; and he gave it a kick. The clang of
the metal echoed and reëchoed through the cave producing a weird sound
and sending the shivers coursing up and down the spines of the
boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds hollow,&#8221; said Grant in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it is,&#8221; John agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lift it and see,&#8221; directed George. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t
there any handles on it?&#8221;</p>

<p>John felt around the sides of the chest and finally discovered that
there was a handle on one end. He pulled and lifted with all his might,
but not one inch could he budge it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew, there must be something in it,&#8221; he panted.
&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly heavy enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s probably full of gold,&#8221; exclaimed George
excitedly. &#8220;Gold is awfully heavy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Calm yourself, Pop,&#8221; said Grant, but he too, was
excited. In fact, the strange cave and the chest suggested all sorts of
things to the four youths. What if they should find that the chest was
full of money? Stranger things than that have happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly sounded hollow in spite of all you say,&#8221;
remarked Fred. &#8220;See if all four of us can&#8217;t get hold and
move it.&#8221; He kicked it once more and again the weird sound rang
through the cave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that, Fred,&#8221; begged George. &#8220;It
gives me the shivers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get hold here then,&#8221; exclaimed Fred.</p>

<p>The combined efforts of the four boys did not even slightly move the
great chest. It was an awkward thing to handle, however, as well as
very heavy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it is empty after all,&#8221; remarked Grant, as they
all paused to regain their breath. &#8220;A chest as big as that would
weigh a lot all alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; admitted Fred. &#8220;At any rate I say we get
it out on the ledge in front there where we can have a good look at
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the idea,&#8221; exclaimed George. &#8220;We can
get it there if we all help. Everybody get to work here now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pushing and hauling, grunting and groaning the young castaways bent
to their task. Little by little the great iron chest was moved closer
and closer to the entrance of the cave. The sweat poured from the boys
in streams and their arms and their backs ached. They would not give
up, however. The lure of treasure had them in its grasp and they were
determined to find out just what the contents of this chest were if
such a thing were possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a little more,&#8221; urged Grant, and with one final
effort the chest was pushed out onto the ledge of rock in front of the
cave.</p>

<p>For a few moments the boys were too exhausted to do more than stand
around puffing and gasping for breath. Such a task, combined with the
heat of the tropics, would tax the strength and endurance of the
hardiest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now let&#8217;s open it up,&#8221; exclaimed Fred.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s the top?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s over on its side,&#8221; said Grant.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s the top and it&#8217;s padlocked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is,&#8221; said Fred disappointedly. &#8220;What can we
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get a rock,&#8221; directed Grant. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty
well rusted and by hammering it we may be able to break it.&#8221;</p>

<p>A suitable rock was quickly found and an attack begun on the
padlock. Grant pounded away for dear life, while the others stood
around and watched him. After a few moments he stopped to inspect the
result of his efforts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think you can do it?&#8221; inquired John.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;I think I made
a little impression on it, but it&#8217;ll take some time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going back into the cave,&#8221; announced
John. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to inspect that patch of light back there.
When you get the box open, yell at me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He disappeared in the dusk of the cave while his three companions
took turns at hammering the lock. It was stubborn, but was beginning to
show some signs of yielding and the boys stuck manfully to their task.
They seemed to be on the verge of succeeding when a great commotion
inside the cave suddenly arrested their attention.</p>

<p>A moment later John burst forth. His face was ashen and his eyes
bulged wide with fear. His hands shook as if he had the ague and his
breath was almost gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, John?&#8221; demanded Grant in alarm, while Fred
and George also crowded around the frightened boy. He had evidently
received a terrible shock of some kind and his three companions were
greatly affected by his appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; exclaimed Grant anxiously,
but all that John could do was to mumble incoherently and point towards
the interior of the cave.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='fss'>AN ODD
DISCOVERY</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;John!&#8221; begged Grant. &#8220;Tell us what&#8217;s the
matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>John, however, was in no condition to say anything. He shivered and
shook, and kept glancing fearfully at the entrance to the cave as
though he expected some great ogre or dragon to emerge any moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch that cave, Pop,&#8221; directed Grant. &#8220;Perhaps
we&#8217;d better get out of here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you talk, John?&#8221; exclaimed Fred.
&#8220;Tell us what the trouble is.&#8221;</p>

<p>John gulped and swallowed hard a couple of times. He pointed towards
the cave and his lips moved, but no sound that resembled a word came
from his ashen-colored lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, John,&#8221; coaxed Fred. &#8220;You&#8217;re all
right. Tell us about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>John made another great effort. &#8220;That man,&#8221; he managed
to gasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Man&#8217;!&#8221; cried Grant. &#8220;What man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw a man,&#8221; said John and then he fainted.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a mess,&#8221; exclaimed Grant in dismay. &#8220;What
shall we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He saw a man,&#8221; said Fred in alarm. &#8220;Who could it
be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do I know?&#8221; said Grant testily. &#8220;Are you
watching that cave, Pop?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly am. Hand me one of those rocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three boys stood on the narrow ledge of rocks in a quandary as
to what course they should pursue. Below them was the steep, rocky
incline of the hill and behind them was the cave containing they knew
not what. At their feet lay their comrade, unconscious and helpless. It
was a situation that would have worried the oldest and most hardened
adventurer.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get John away from here,&#8221; said Grant
at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; objected Fred. &#8220;We
can&#8217;t carry him down this hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But suppose we&#8217;re attacked,&#8221; said Grant
dolefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to run that risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going into the cave,&#8221; George announced
suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pop!&#8221; cried Grant in alarm. &#8220;You stay where you
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not go in and clear up the mystery right now?&#8221; said
George. &#8220;We might just as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re crazy,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
think of such a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing hurt John,&#8221; said George soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; cried Grant, &#8220;but look at him now. He was
scared almost to death!&#8221;</p>

<p>The three boys gazed apprehensively at the entrance of the cave.
They all had rocks in their hands now and were ready to let them fly
the moment the man John had seen should show his head. Nothing
appeared, however.</p>

<p>After a moment John stirred and opened his eyes. He looked about him
in a puzzled way as though he did not know where he was. Then he
evidently remembered his experience for he shuddered and cast a
terror-stricken glance at the dark entrance of the cave.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw a man,&#8221; he repeated in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of a man? Who was it?&#8221; demanded Grant
eagerly. &#8220;Keep your eye on that cave, Pop,&#8221; he added
grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us what happened,&#8221; urged Fred.</p>

<p>John was much more composed now and had better control of
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went into the cave,&#8221; he began. &#8220;I walked along
and didn&#8217;t see a thing. I was beginning to think that that chest
was the only thing there and I kept thinking what a strange thing it
was. I had gone in to find out where that patch of light came from you
know, so when I came to it I looked up.&#8221; John stopped
speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221; demanded Grant in a tense voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw a man,&#8221; said John, and he shivered violently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; urged Grant. &#8220;What kind of a man did you
see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An old man with white hair and a long white beard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was looking in the other end of the opening. I just took
one look at him and ran.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he see you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t wait for
anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was he alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; said John. &#8220;At least I saw only one.
I suppose I am a coward to be so frightened by an old man like that,
but it was so unexpected. The opening was narrow like a chimney-flue
and it gave me such a start to see some one at the other
end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t blame you,&#8221; said Grant grimly.
&#8220;It would have scared me too.&#8221;</p>

<p>John scrambled to his feet. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go back in and see if
he&#8217;s still there. I&#8217;m ashamed of the way I acted and I want
to make up for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I say,&#8221; exclaimed George.
&#8220;Clear up this business. One old man can&#8217;t hurt us very
much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless he has a gun,&#8221; said Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; agreed George. &#8220;I never
thought of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much chance of his having a gun, I guess,&#8221; said
Grant. &#8220;I&#8217;ll risk it anyway if the rest will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it was Sam you saw,&#8221; said Fred suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;With white hair and a white beard? I guess not,&#8221;
laughed George grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He might have been playing a joke on us,&#8221; suggested
Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he was, he&#8217;ll never live to tell the tale,&#8221;
cried John fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that fellow was looking through the top of that opening,
he won&#8217;t be in the cave,&#8221; said Grant suddenly. &#8220;Why
don&#8217;t we look for him on top of the hill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; agreed George. &#8220;Can we get up
from here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The four boys looked up to see what kind of a climb it would be.
Suddenly, Fred burst out laughing. His companions turned and looked at
him in amazement. He laughed and laughed until the tears came to his
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s struck you, Fred?&#8221; demanded George
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, John,&#8221; gasped Fred, when he could get his breath.
&#8220;You poor simpleton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; exclaimed John in
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see an old man with white hair and a long
beard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I did. That&#8217;s what I said, didn&#8217;t
I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there he is,&#8221; and once more Fred became convulsed
with merriment.</p>

<p>His three companions looked in the direction he had indicated. At
the brow of the hill, alongside a large rock, and gazing curiously down
at them stood an old billy goat. His white beard gave him a most odd
appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the old man you saw?&#8221; demanded Grant, turning
toward John. One glance at his companion, however, was enough to give
him his answer. A foolish expression spread itself over John&#8217;s
face and he became very red and embarrassed. He mumbled something under
his breath, but no one could make out what it was that he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, String,&#8221; cried George, &#8220;you certainly put
your foot in it that time. I guess you&#8217;ll never hear the end of
it either. You surely won&#8217;t if I have anything to say about it.
An old man with a white beard. Baa!&#8221; and George imitated a goat
and he too gave vent to uncontrollable laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a goat at each end of the opening, wasn&#8217;t
there, Pop?&#8221; inquired Grant mischievously.</p>

<p>&#8220;There sure was,&#8221; George agreed. &#8220;The big one was
at the bottom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fred, Grant, and George laughed and then laughed some more. They
slapped John on the back and twitted him repeatedly about the false
alarm he had given. They enjoyed themselves immensely at their
friend&#8217;s expense. He, however, was very much ashamed and very
unhappy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I admit I was the goat,&#8221; he said sadly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know what got into me, but it was such a shock to see that
funny looking face staring in at the other end of that opening. It
scared the life out of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say it did,&#8221; chuckled George. &#8220;You
scared us, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; John apologized.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything I can to make up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we have him do?&#8221; exclaimed Fred eagerly.
&#8220;It ought to be something pretty bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make him open that chest,&#8221; Grant suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good scheme,&#8221; said George.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s a big rock for you, String. Hit it a few cracks and
see if you are better at this than at exploring caves.&#8221;</p>

<p>John approached the chest, rock in hand. The lock had already been
bent considerably by the other boys&#8217; efforts, but it still held
fast. John attacked it fiercely and after breaking several stones
succeeded in demolishing the lock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, String!&#8221; cried George, excitedly.
&#8220;You&#8217;re a wonder. Open it up! Quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>The padlock was removed and all four boys crowded around and eagerly
grasped the top. It was not so easy to open, however, but finally it
was done. Every boy&#8217;s eyes glistened expectantly as the top was
raised. The least they expected to see was a great pile of gold, but no
such sight presented itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s empty,&#8221; cried Grant. His voice sounded as if
he had lost his last friend on earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a piece of paper in there,&#8221; corrected
Fred. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see if that says anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keen disappointment showed on the face of every boy. Their hopes had
been dashed. There was no special reason why they should have expected
to find such a treasure-chest as they had pictured this one to be, but
this idea had fixed itself in their minds and they really counted on
all being made rich the moment they opened it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does the paper say, Fred?&#8221; inquired Grant
listlessly. Most of his interest had faded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Fred carelessly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing but a bunch of mixed up numbers. Say,&#8221;
he exclaimed suddenly. &#8220;Let me see that code in your
pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want that for?&#8221; inquired Grant curiously,
at the same time producing the article in question and handing it over
to Fred.</p>

<p>Fred grasped it and quickly spread it open. Holding the one he had
found in the chest alongside the other he ran his eye hurriedly over
the two. Then he turned to his three companions, who were watching him
curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know that these two papers are exactly alike?&#8221;
he demanded excitedly.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='fss'>SAM
REMEMBERS SOMETHING</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Alike?&#8221; cried Grant in amazement. &#8220;What do you
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I said,&#8221; returned Fred. &#8220;The numbers on
these two papers are exactly the same from start to finish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the strangest thing I ever heard of in my
life,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;Let me look at them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you fellows that that piece of parchment
Petersen had was a code of some sort?&#8221; demanded Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does the fact that we found one like it prove that?&#8221;
said George skeptically.</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly seems so to me,&#8221; Fred exclaimed. &#8220;At
any rate, it is a very odd coincidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that all right,&#8221; admitted George. &#8220;Are
they exactly alike, Grant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They seem to be,&#8221; replied Grant, who had been carefully
studying the two papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can soon find out, anyway,&#8221; said John. &#8220;Let me
have one of them and I&#8217;ll read it aloud. One of you fellows can
watch the other and check up the numbers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good scheme,&#8221; Grant agreed. &#8220;Here,
String, you take this one and I&#8217;ll keep my eye on the numbers on
the other as you call them off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready?&#8221; said John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; and this is what John read:</p>

<p>&#8220;20-1-11-5-1-3-15-21-18-19-5-4-21-5-14-15-18-20-8-15-14-15-18-21-14-4-18-5-4-6-5-5-20-6-18-15-13-20-8-5-19-15-21-20-8-5-18-14-5-24-20-18-5-13-9-20-25-15-6-19-8-1-18-11-18-15-3-11-20-8-5-14-5-1-19-20-6-9-6-20-25-6-20-25-6-5-5-20-1-14-4-14-15-18-20-8-2-25-5-1-19-20-20-8-9-18-20-25-20-8-18-5-5-4-9-7.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly the same,&#8221; announced Grant when John had
finished. &#8220;Now what do you think about that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe it&#8217;s a code which tells where some pirates
have buried treasure,&#8221; announced Fred decidedly. &#8220;I also
believe that this is the island where it was done. How else do you
account for our finding that duplicate in the chest here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s strange all right,&#8221; said George. &#8220;I
can explain it all in a different way, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Grant curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just this. Suppose all those numbers do make up a code and
that they do give the key to some treasure or something. Isn&#8217;t it
possible that the treasure was once in this empty chest, and some one
found it and took it away? Evidently there were at least two people in
the secret, as the two codes show. One of them got here first and took
it away and as long as he had no more use for the code he left it.
Doesn&#8217;t that sound reasonable?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it does,&#8221; Fred admitted. &#8220;It&#8217;s not
very cheerful, though, and I hope you are wrong about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so, too,&#8221; exclaimed George heartily.
&#8220;It&#8217;s just as well to look at both sides,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe your idea is right, Pop,&#8221; said
Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Petersen got this code from his father, didn&#8217;t he?
Well, if his father and the men he was with buried that treasure on
this island it seems strange that this old powder-horn and flint-lock
pistol should be here. Such things as that were used a good many years
before Petersen&#8217;s father was alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who said his father was the one who buried the
treasure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought that was what some one said back there on the
<i>Josephine</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed. They said Petersen&#8217;s father had the code,
but I never heard that he was one of those who were supposed to have
buried the treasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate,&#8221; put in George, &#8220;no matter who
buried it, it doesn&#8217;t say that my theory is wrong. The pistol and
the powder-horn may have been in the chest along with the treasure.
Whoever found it thought they weren&#8217;t worth taking, so they were
just thrown to one side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why was the chest locked again?&#8221; asked John.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; laughed Grant.
&#8220;I give up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;Don&#8217;t say
that. We can at least try to make out this code. That will give us
something to do and I guess we are going to have plenty of time on our
hands before we get away from here.&#8221; As he finished speaking he
turned to scan the horizon, but nothing was in sight save the endless
expanse of ocean. As far as appearances went they might have been alone
in the world. The occasional note of a bird and the soft murmur of the
waves as they caressed the beach below were the only sounds to be
heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess we will,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;As you say,
we can at least try to decipher it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no good at such things,&#8221; exclaimed George.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I ever worked out a puzzle in all my
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t say you can&#8217;t do this, though, does
it?&#8221; demanded Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no. Perhaps I&#8217;ll get an idea some day and work the
whole thing out for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have an idea right now,&#8221; said John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better tell us what it is, quick,&#8221; urged George.
&#8220;You may lose it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not like some other people I know,&#8221; said John
loftily.</p>

<p>To this remark George made no intelligible answer, though he
muttered something under his breath. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad of
it,&#8221; was what two of his companions made out his reply to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your idea, String?&#8221; asked Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say to take possession of this cave and live
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good scheme,&#8221; exclaimed Fred heartily.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s go and get our few belongings just as soon as we can
and bring them up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A fine idea,&#8221; agreed George. &#8220;String, I
didn&#8217;t think you knew so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That proves that you know very little yourself, then,&#8221;
replied John scornfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha. Good one, String,&#8221; cried Fred laughingly.
&#8220;Give him another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not worth bothering about,&#8221; said John.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s get our things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Down the side of the hill they scrambled, slipping and sliding down
the steep decline. They came to the bottom in safety, however, and it
was not long before they reached the spot where the baggage had been
left.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Sam?&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;He
certainly can&#8217;t be sleeping still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is,&#8221; said Fred, pointing down the beach.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he got in his hand?&#8221; said George
curiously. &#8220;It looks like a knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where could he get a knife?&#8221; exclaimed John.
&#8220;Just as I told you a few minutes ago, Pop, you&#8217;ve
certainly got something missing in that head of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought maybe he&#8217;d gone around to the hardware store
and bought it,&#8221; drawled George soberly with a wink at Grant. He
loved to stir up his companions, and none of them more so than his tall
friend, John, who almost invariably rose to any bait he might happen to
offer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you got there, Sam?&#8221; called Fred when the
negro was within earshot.</p>

<p>Sam merely grinned and waved the object he held in his hand to the
boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I said before it certainly looks like a knife,&#8221;
murmured George.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that, Sam?&#8221; asked Fred again when Sam had come
up to the spot where the four boys were standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&#8217;s makin&#8217; a knife,&#8221; said Sam proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get the steel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat ain&#8217;t steel,&#8221; grinned Sam. &#8220;Dat am one
o&#8217; dem iron hoops off o&#8217; dat dere bar&#8217;el o&#8217; water. Ah
is gwine sharpen her up and den we&#8217;ll hab a sho&#8217; nuff
knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;ll never cut much,&#8221; laughed
John. &#8220;No knife with a blade made of iron is apt to be much good.
It&#8217;ll be all right to dig holes in the ground with,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait &#8217;til she&#8217;s sharpened,&#8221; warned Sam.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you going to sharpen it?&#8221; asked Grant
curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;On a big black rock Ah done discovah roun&#8217; dat dere
point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The rock that looks like a shark,&#8221; exclaimed George.
&#8220;That ought to be a good one, for it certainly seemed hard
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat rock look lak a shark, yo&#8217; say?&#8221; remarked Sam
suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said George. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you think
so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now dat Ah comes to think on it, it sho&#8217; did,&#8221;
said Sam. &#8220;Ah wondahs if dis yere can be de island.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; demanded Fred eagerly. &#8220;What
island?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Sam, &#8220;evah sence Ah done commence to
foller de sea Ah has heard tales of some island where dey is treasah
buried. Dat island was said to hab a big rock on it what done look lak
a shark. Mebbe this am de one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where was this island?&#8221; asked George eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one ebber knew,&#8221; said Sam. &#8220;All Ah knows is
dat on dis island dey said dere was all so&#8217;ts ob treasah. Yo&#8217;
could tell de pahtikelah island by its habbin&#8217; a big rock on it
what done look lak a shark. Dat&#8217;s all Ah knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever meet any one who had seen the island?&#8221;
inquired Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nebber,&#8221; replied Sam. &#8220;Some say dat de island
done disappeah or dat de ocean had swallowed &#8217;er up. Dese was all
stories Ah heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; exclaimed Fred, his eyes shining with
excitement. &#8220;I certainly am in favor of finding out what those
codes mean. Perhaps we&#8217;ll find something on this island after
all. I&#8217;ll bet this is the one Sam has heard about all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems so, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; agreed Grant. &#8220;We
may get rich yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The treasure was in that chest up there in the cave, I tell
you,&#8221; said George. &#8220;Some one has been here and taken it
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; cried Fred. &#8220;At any rate
there&#8217;s more of it here. Didn&#8217;t you hear Sam say that he
has heard about this island for years and years?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not sure this is the one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m pretty sure there aren&#8217;t two islands
with rocks on them like that,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;A rock
shaped just like a shark is so unusual that you see they identify the
island by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why has no one ever found it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You just said they had,&#8221; Grant reminded him. &#8220;You
also said that the treasure was gone. You are contradicting
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;d think some one would find it,&#8221;
exclaimed George. &#8220;An island as big as this one couldn&#8217;t
very well be overlooked if any one came near it at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Apparently no one does come near it,&#8221; said Fred.
&#8220;How many boats have we seen since the <i>Josephine</i>
burned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not one,&#8221; said Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is it?&#8221; demanded Fred. &#8220;In this day and age,
when the ocean is so covered with ships, you&#8217;d certainly think
we&#8217;d see at least one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We never even saw any of the other lifeboats,&#8221; said
John.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; Fred exclaimed. &#8220;How do you
account for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;It&#8217;s a strange
thing all around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if we&#8217;re going to be stranded here for a few
years we might just as well spend part of the time looking for the
treasure,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;Everything seems to point to the
fact that there is some here. That cave and the chest and the two codes
and the queer rock that fits in so well with what Sam has heard,
everything about it sounds like treasure and lots of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we could only be the ones to find it,&#8221; sighed John.
&#8220;Just think of going home rich; rich with pearls and diamonds and
emeralds and gold doubloons and bars of gold all dug up from some old
pirate&#8217;s hiding place. If we only could!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps we can,&#8221; exclaimed Fred, much thrilled by
John&#8217;s description of the wealth that might be theirs. &#8220;My
opinion is that we must translate those codes first, though.
Wouldn&#8217;t it be awful if they didn&#8217;t apply to this island
after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they do,&#8221; insisted Grant. &#8220;I know they
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I think so, too,&#8221; exclaimed John.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s go to work.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='fss'>THE
RIDDLE</span></h2>

<p>Days passed and weeks rolled by. The four friends and their colored
companion still remained on the mysterious island. The flag still flew
from the hill and all day long one or another of the boys kept a
lookout from a spot near by. No boat came to rescue them, however, and
the little party of castaways had almost come to believe that the rest
of their days were to be spent on this little island somewhere in an
unknown sea.</p>

<p>Once John on watch had seen smoke. Far off on the horizon appeared a
smudge from the funnels of some passing steamer. It was too far away
however to discover their signal or even to see their island. He had
watched it hopefully until it finally disappeared over the rim of the
ocean. That was the only sign of a vessel that had been sighted so
far.</p>

<p>However, the boys were not in want. Their clothes were becoming
ragged and their hair unkempt, but they were well fed and healthy. If
it had not been for the fact that they knew they could not leave they
might have been measurably contented. They were now living in the cave
as snug and comfortable as could be desired. The fact that they were
short of clothes did not bother them, either, for the weather was warm
and clothes were more of a burden than a necessity.</p>

<p>As yet they had discovered no treasure. Hour after hour they had
puzzled over the mysterious numbers on the parchment, but as yet no one
had been able to solve their riddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes me mad,&#8221; said John one day. &#8220;I sit and
stare at those crazy figures until it seems as if I must go crazy
myself. I never get even a clew as to what they mean, but at the same
time the more I study them the more sure I am that they have a
meaning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I, too,&#8221; agreed Grant. &#8220;I know they mean
something. I&#8217;m sure of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Until we discover what it is we are practically
helpless,&#8221; said John. &#8220;We can&#8217;t dig up the whole
island looking for buried gold, you know. We must have
directions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly would laugh,&#8221; exclaimed George, &#8220;if
some one did find out what those figures mean and then we discovered
that it didn&#8217;t apply to this island at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would be so funny in that?&#8221; demanded Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think how you&#8217;d all be fooled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and you&#8217;d be just as badly off as any of
us,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t find any money, you
won&#8217;t get anything any more than we will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he doesn&#8217;t like money,&#8221; said John.
&#8220;He seems sort of hopeful that we won&#8217;t find
any.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to prove to me that you are going to find
any first,&#8221; said George. &#8220;A set of funny looking numbers
and a queer looking rock that Sam says he remembers hearing about and a
cave with an empty chest in it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean money, in
my opinion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey does in mine,&#8221; exclaimed Sam, rolling his eyes
rapturously towards heaven. &#8220;Ef we only could find dat treasah Ah
sho&#8217; would show dem fresh coons back dar in Richmond a thing or
two. Oh, Lawdy!&#8221; and Sam executed a few steps of a clog dance
just to show his delight at the mere thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you do if you had a lot of money, Sam?&#8221;
asked Grant smilingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; began the enthusiastic darky, &#8220;de berry
fust thing dat Ah would do would be to buy mahself de grandes&#8217;
lookin&#8217; suit ob clothes yo&#8217; ebber did see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of a suit?&#8221; inquired Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;A checked suit,&#8221; said Sam. &#8220;A checked suit wif
black an&#8217; white checks as big as a postage stamp. Den Ah would
get mahself some ob dem dare patent leather shoes. Den,&#8221; and Sam
drew in his breath luxuriously, &#8220;Ah would purchase a bran&#8217;
span red necktie an&#8217; square in de middle ob dat Ah would place de
bigges&#8217; an&#8217; de grandes&#8217; diamon&#8217; ho&#8217;shoe
yo&#8217; ebber set yo&#8217; eyes upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all you&#8217;d buy?&#8221; laughed George.</p>

<p>Sam gave him a scornful look. &#8220;No, indeedy,&#8221; he
maintained stoutly. &#8220;Nex&#8217; Ah would buy one o&#8217; dem
high shiny hats and den a cane, den a pair of dem yaller gloves,
an&#8217; say, mebbe dem niggahs back home wouldn&#8217; be jealous ob
Samuel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess they would, all right,&#8221; exclaimed Grant, much
entertained by Sam&#8217;s description of the way he would spend his
money. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you buy anything but clothes,
though?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ob co&#8217;se Ah would,&#8221; said Sam. &#8220;Not at de fust,
though. Ah&#8217;d jest get mah new clothes on an&#8217; den walk down
de street so&#8217;t ob cahless like an&#8217; in two minutes yo&#8217;
gwine see ebbery wench in town jes&#8217; a follerin&#8217; me. Oh,
say, golly, mebbe dem niggahs wouldn&#8217;t be jealous!&#8221; and Sam
laughed aloud, the thought was so pleasant for him to contemplate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you get it, Sam,&#8221; said Fred heartily.
&#8220;If you get it we all do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except Pop,&#8221; added Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not me?&#8221; demanded George in an aggrieved tone.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t I get any?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything here
worth taking,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;You keep making fun of us all
the time and telling us there is no treasure on the island. If you
aren&#8217;t interested enough to do some work it seems only natural
that you won&#8217;t want any of the treasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you little shrimp,&#8221; exclaimed George, pretending
to be very angry and glowering down upon his stubby companion,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you know that I have been joshing you fellows all
this time? If there&#8217;s anything here worth working for you can be
dead sure I&#8217;m willing to do my share. All I say is that you prove
it to me first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should we prove it to you?&#8221; inquired Grant.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you get to work and help us prove it to
ourselves? After we have found where the stuff is any one can go and
get it. What we want to know is the spot where it&#8217;s
hidden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite true,&#8221; George admitted. &#8220;At the same time
you must admit that you are all taking a great deal for granted. You
seem to think that there is no doubt about there being treasure on the
island and also that this code when deciphered will tell you just where
it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We hope that&#8217;s the case,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;Of
course we can&#8217;t tell until we&#8217;ve found out what the code
says. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to do now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; agreed George. &#8220;We must get
to work on it at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been at work on it ever since we struck this
island,&#8221; said Fred warmly. &#8220;Where have you been all this
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, when I get down to business we&#8217;ll soon solve the
riddle,&#8221; said George pompously. &#8220;I&#8217;ll soon get an
idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit him, Grant,&#8221; cried John. &#8220;You&#8217;re
nearest to him and we ought not to let such things live.&#8221;</p>

<p>George burst out laughing. &#8220;Forget those old numbers for a
while,&#8221; he advised. &#8220;So far no one has been able to do
anything with them, but if we let them alone for a few days we can go
back to them with our minds fresh. Who knows, somebody might get an
idea all of a sudden that would solve the whole business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish somebody would,&#8221; sighed Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of this, though,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;Suppose
we do forget it all for a few days, as Pop suggests. In the meantime a
boat might come along and take us away and our chance of ever finding
the treasure would be gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Grant,&#8221; cried John. &#8220;We
don&#8217;t want to lose an opportunity like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we take the code home with us?&#8221; said
George. &#8220;We have all the rest of our lives to find out what it
means and if it is worth while we can always come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can we tell whether it is worth while or not until we see
it?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably that code contains a description of what it
is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it does,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;We&#8217;ll know
better when we find out just what it does say. I&#8217;m in favor of
keeping right at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I, Grant,&#8221; exclaimed John. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let
it rest for a second.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s de boy!&#8221; cried Sam heartily. &#8220;Ah get
dat diamon&#8217; ho&#8217;shoe yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I hope you get a big automobile to go with it,
Sam,&#8221; said Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah hopes so mahself,&#8221; grinned Sam. &#8220;Say,
wouldn&#8217;t dat be gran&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll all have them,&#8221; said John.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have motor-boats and yachts, too, and maybe
flying-machines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stick a pin in that fellow, Fred,&#8221; urged George.
&#8220;He&#8217;s asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; exclaimed John. &#8220;At any rate,
it&#8217;s cheap enough to dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; laughed George. &#8220;Go ahead and
dream if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one of us ought to be able to read that code,&#8221;
said Grant. &#8220;Why should a lot of figures get the better of us? We
ought not to let them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe the numbers mean letters,&#8221; George suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve all thought that ourselves,&#8221; said Grant
grimly. &#8220;Just what letters, though?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see the thing,&#8221; exclaimed George. &#8220;What
number occurs oftenest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; mused Grant, looking over his
shoulder. &#8220;I guess five does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right then,&#8221; said George quickly; &#8220;now what
is the commonest letter in the alphabet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought of that, too,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;The trouble
is that none of us know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That might be an idea, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted John, &#8220;but if we don&#8217;t know
those things I don&#8217;t see how we can get very far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; said George. &#8220;We might try some
experiments, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; urged Grant. &#8220;Try everything you can
think of. We&#8217;ve nothing to lose and everything to gain. No matter
how silly an idea may seem to you, try it. That&#8217;s the only way we
can ever get anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right you are, Grant!&#8221; exclaimed Fred.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the way to talk. If we stick to it, I know
we&#8217;ll find out all about it some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps we will &#8216;some day,&#8217;&#8221; said George
mournfully.</p>

<h2><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span
class='fss'>UNDERGROUND WORK</span></h2>

<p>One day John was standing at the back of the cave looking up through
the opening which was there. Here it was that the billy goat had given
him such a fright a few weeks before. This time, however, he did not
see any &#8220;white bearded old man&#8221; as he gazed up into the
aperture, but he did spy something almost equally interesting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Fred!&#8221; he called. &#8220;Come here a
minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fred hastened to respond to his friend&#8217;s summons and soon
reached the spot where John was standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want, String?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look up through that opening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Fred, doing as he had been directed.
&#8220;I&#8217;m looking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I do. I see the sky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly, Fred,&#8221; exclaimed John. &#8220;In
the opening, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see dirt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely. What are you trying to do, anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About three feet this side of the other end; don&#8217;t you
see something sticking out?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fred squinted one eye and peered upward critically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see a thing?&#8221; demanded John
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I do,&#8221; replied Fred. &#8220;Is something sticking
out up there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I thought. What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like the end of a box.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I thought myself,&#8221; exclaimed John
triumphantly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t reach it from this end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it. We&#8217;ll have to climb up on top of the
hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; urged Fred, now also keenly excited.</p>

<p>Outside the cave, Grant sat puzzling over the numbers. Most of his
time he now spent in this way, and though he was apparently no nearer a
solution than when he had started, his determination was stronger than
ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you two fellows going?&#8221; he demanded as John
and Fred rushed past the spot where he was seated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just up on top of the hill,&#8221; said John evasively. He
and Fred had decided not to tell any of the others of their discovery
until they had investigated it thoroughly themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to be in an awful hurry,&#8221; remarked Grant.
&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell you later,&#8221; answered John, and they quickly passed
out of Grant&#8217;s sight. A moment more and they had arrived at the
top of the opening which led down into the cave.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see anything from here,&#8221; exclaimed John,
after a hasty examination. &#8220;The shadow of my head gets right in
the way and I can&#8217;t see a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me look,&#8221; urged Fred, but he could make out nothing
either.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what to do,&#8221; he exclaimed a moment later.
&#8220;Hang onto my feet so I won&#8217;t fall and get wedged in there,
and then lower me into the hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good scheme,&#8221; said John eagerly.
&#8220;You&#8217;re little and skinny and ought to be able to get in
there all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind the &#8216;little and skinny&#8217; part,&#8221; said
Fred shortly. &#8220;You hold onto my feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anyone who might have passed by that way and seen John holding fast
to a pair of legs sticking out of a hole in the ground would have been
puzzled as to what was taking place. Grant&#8217;s curiosity had been
aroused by the strange actions of his two friends and he had followed
them. Imagine his surprise to see what John and Fred were doing, but he
said nothing. He stood quietly near by and neither of his comrades was
aware of his presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you see anything, Fred?&#8221; called John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing,&#8221; came back the muffled reply. &#8220;I can
feel something, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it a box?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell, I think it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you move it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not. It&#8217;s stuck fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull me out and I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later Fred emerged, his face covered with dirt.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you two doing?&#8221; demanded Grant, who now
approached the two conspirators. &#8220;You look as though you were
training to be a mole, Fred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a box down in there,&#8221; said Fred.
&#8220;We want to get it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A box!&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;How big is
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could only feel one end of it. It&#8217;s about a foot wide
I should say. I don&#8217;t know how long it is for all the rest of it
is buried in there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you budge it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not an inch. We&#8217;ll have to dig it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get that knife Sam made,&#8221; exclaimed John.
&#8220;That&#8217;ll be just the thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sam&#8217;s up by the flag on watch,&#8221; Grant called as
John started off. &#8220;I think he has the knife with him. Who
discovered the box?&#8221; he inquired, turning to Fred. Grant was now
as excited as the other two boys had been.</p>

<p>&#8220;John did,&#8221; said Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did he happen to do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he was looking up from the bottom and just happened to
see it. He showed it to me and we came up to investigate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe this one has the real stuff in it,&#8221; said Grant
excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe so,&#8221; Fred agreed. &#8220;All I hope is that we
can dig it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we can,&#8221; said Grant confidently. &#8220;Here
comes String now.&#8221;</p>

<p>John came running up, out of breath, and handed the knife to Fred.
&#8220;I told Sam we had discovered a box,&#8221; he panted. &#8220;Sam
says that if there are any diamond horseshoes in it they belong to him.
That&#8217;s the only condition on which he would let me have the
knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; laughed Fred. &#8220;Sam gets all the
horseshoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to do the digging, Fred?&#8221; asked John.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;d better. Let me have the knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Holding the home-made blade in his right hand he was once again
lowered into the tunnel. John and Grant each held fast to one leg. It
was hard work for Fred for he was in comparative darkness and was
compelled to feel around to discover where to dig. It was practically
impossible for him to see anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s it coming?&#8221; called John after a few moments
had elapsed.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied Fred, his voice sounding as if it
came from the center of the earth. &#8220;I&#8217;m spilling a lot of
dirt down into the cave though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind that, as long as you don&#8217;t lose any of the
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really think there&#8217;s any gold or anything in
that box?&#8221; said Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; John replied.
&#8220;If Pop were here he&#8217;d be sure it was empty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it. Isn&#8217;t he a regular old gloom
lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not usually that way. At least he never used to
be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something has come over him since we started work on that
code. He thinks it&#8217;s very silly and that we are foolish to bother
with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll surprise him one of these days,&#8221; said John
confidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly hope so,&#8221; exclaimed Grant.</p>

<p>While Fred dug they chatted and talked of the possibilities of their
finding some long forgotten pirate&#8217;s treasure and making
themselves rich and famous. Almost anyone would have been as thrilled
as these boys were under the same circumstances. Petersen&#8217;s tale
on board the <i>Josephine</i> and the strange code he had had; the
finding of a similar one in the cave; the chest and the powder-horn and
pistol; the queer black rock and Sam&#8217;s story in connection with
it; all these events had combined to spur the four young adventurers on
in their quest. Now they had discovered another odd looking box and
with the hope that springs eternal in the human breast they were
anxiously and eagerly awaiting a chance to examine its contents.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Pull me up,&#8221; came Fred&#8217;s summons at
last.</p>

<p>Slowly and carefully John and Grant lifted their companion out of
the hole. Soon he emerged, the knife in one hand, the box in the other
and with so much dirt and grime that its owner was scarcely
recognizable.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look like Sam,&#8221; remarked John, hardly able to
restrain his mirth at Fred&#8217;s appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open the box and don&#8217;t get so personal,&#8221; advised
Fred, wiping the dirt from his eyes.</p>

<p>Grant was already busily engaged in examining the prize his friend
had dug from its place in the earth. &#8220;This one is light,&#8221;
he remarked. &#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose there is anything in it at
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you open it?&#8221; demanded John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easily. There&#8217;s only a catch on it,&#8221; and Grant
straightway lifted the cover.</p>

<p>&#8220;An envelope,&#8221; exclaimed Fred disappointedly. &#8220;All
that work for nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grant, however, was opening the envelope and as he did so two gold
pieces rolled out upon the ground. &#8220;Empty is it?&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;How about those?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; exclaimed John excitedly. &#8220;Just look at
them. Are there any more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just this,&#8221; said Grant quietly and he spread a sheet of
paper before the gaze of his two companions. &#8220;Do you recognize
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should know those figures in China now,&#8221; said Fred
disgustedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s that same old code again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said Grant, &#8220;but do you see
what&#8217;s written across the top?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure enough,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;What does it say,
anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;This tells where the rest of it is,&#8217;&#8221; Grant read
aloud.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='fss'>IN THE
WATER</span></h2>

<p>John, Fred and Grant sat and looked at one another and at the two
gold pieces which lay glittering in John&#8217;s hand. Then they looked
at the third copy of the code which had turned up so strangely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish Pop were here,&#8221; remarked Grant grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why so?&#8221; inquired Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like him to see those gold pieces and I&#8217;d
like him to see what is written across the top of this parchment. I
think after that he wouldn&#8217;t be so sure there was no treasure on
this island. We&#8217;ll convince him now quick enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see one of those coins,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;What
are they, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spanish, I should say,&#8221; replied John.
&#8220;They&#8217;re old ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think so,&#8221; exclaimed Fred.
&#8220;They&#8217;re worn, too, and the date is gone from this
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This says seventeen something,&#8221; remarked John,
examining the piece of gold which he held in his hand. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t make out the rest of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They must be a couple of hundred years old, all right,&#8221;
said Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose they&#8217;ve been here all that
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you, Grant,&#8221; said John. &#8220;I do
wish we could decipher that code though. This makes it look better than
ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It surely does,&#8221; Grant agreed heartily.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of about everything under the sun, but
nothing seems to work for a cent. I&#8217;d like to catch the fellow
who made up that set of figures. He must have been a fiend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not necessarily,&#8221; laughed Fred. &#8220;He was only
trying to protect his property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess he did that all right,&#8221; exclaimed Grant.
&#8220;He certainly did as far as I am concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The joke of it is,&#8221; said John, &#8220;that probably the
whole thing is as simple as rolling off a log. All we need is the
key.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; cried Grant, &#8220;but if we can&#8217;t find
the key what good does it do us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None, I&#8217;ll admit,&#8221; replied John, &#8220;but we
must find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s easy enough to say that,&#8221; exclaimed
Grant bitterly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t notice anybody doing it,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to give it up are you, Grant?&#8221;
asked Fred in surprise. &#8220;Why this is the best encouragement
we&#8217;ve had yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it up! Of course I&#8217;m not going to give it up. I
don&#8217;t see much encouragement here though. I think it&#8217;s only
more maddening. What we&#8217;ve found to-day only goes to prove that
this code does tell where treasure is buried, but it doesn&#8217;t tell
us how to read the code, does it? It only tantalizes us, but you can
make up your mind that I&#8217;m not going to give up, even for a
second.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What Pop said was probably true,&#8221; remarked John.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; asked Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that all of a sudden somebody would get an idea and the
whole thing will be solved. I think that&#8217;s what will happen
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;I wish it would be
soon, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe Pop already has an idea,&#8221; laughed Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt it,&#8221; said John. &#8220;Where is he
anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He went for a walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. He just said he was going for a
walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s go down and take a swim,&#8221; exclaimed
Fred. &#8220;It&#8217;s awfully hot and a little water certainly
wouldn&#8217;t hurt me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not,&#8221; laughed John. &#8220;I never saw so
much dirt on any man&#8217;s face in all my life. You&#8217;re a
sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; Fred agreed. &#8220;Still,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;I found a couple of gold pieces, didn&#8217;t I? And I&#8217;m
always willing to get dirty under those conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you are,&#8221; agreed John. &#8220;How much do you
suppose they&#8217;re worth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Grant, &#8220;they look to me about the
size of a twenty-dollar gold piece. They ought to be worth thirty-five
or forty dollars easily enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just imagine finding a whole chest full of them,&#8221;
exclaimed Fred, his eyes shining. &#8220;Why, we&#8217;d never have to
do any work as long as we lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d soon get tired of doing nothing, I&#8217;m
afraid,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;Anyway we haven&#8217;t found them
yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk about it,&#8221; exclaimed John. &#8220;That
code is the most maddening thing I ever saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three boys now were walking down towards the shore. Their
favorite spot in which to swim was the little ledge from which they had
watched the many colored fish and the various forms of sea-life the
first day they had landed on the island. Here the water was deep and
the ledge made an excellent place from which to dive.</p>

<p>A few moments later the three friends were puffing and blowing about
in the water enjoying themselves immensely. Their bodies from long
exposure to the rays of the tropical sun were tanned until they might
have been easily mistaken for South Sea islanders or some other natives
of the hot climates. Their hair, too, had grown long, for it had been
many weeks since they had seen a barber. What few clothes they wore
were beginning to hang in rags so that altogether they presented a
strange appearance. Any chance visitor to their island might have
thought he had run across the remnants of some wild race of
savages.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that was pretty good, I should say,&#8221; said John
luxuriously as he stretched himself out on the rocks alongside his two
companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;It surely was,&#8221; agreed Fred. &#8220;This is about the
best part of it, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lying out in the sun this way. Doesn&#8217;t it feel
good?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t be better,&#8221; agreed Grant.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this a lazy life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good one, though,&#8221; said John. &#8220;Just
think, we haven&#8217;t a thing to worry about. All we have to do is
swim and sleep and lie around in the sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say we had plenty to worry about,&#8221; said
Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting home, you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. We can&#8217;t stay here all our lives, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; John agreed. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be
picked up some day though, sure. We can&#8217;t do anything in the
meantime that will help us to leave here, so what&#8217;s the use in
worrying about it? That&#8217;s the way I feel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, too,&#8221; exclaimed Fred.
&#8220;Still, it&#8217;s a very strange thing that we don&#8217;t ever
see any boats. We may be here for years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What if we are? That doesn&#8217;t make anything to worry
about either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the treasure?&#8221; demanded Grant.
&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t that worry you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes it does,&#8221; admitted John. &#8220;I&#8217;m
principally worried for fear some boat will come along and take us away
before we find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s all go back to the cave and make another try at
that code,&#8221; exclaimed Grant, springing to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to go in that water again before I do anything
else,&#8221; said John. &#8220;It certainly is wonderful
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Fred. &#8220;One more
dive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Three bodies flashed through the air and disappeared beneath the
water with a resounding splash. A moment later and three heads came to
the surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming out?&#8221; demanded Grant, blowing the water from his
nostrils and shaking the hair out of his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll take a little swim,&#8221; said John.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be out in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll wait for you,&#8221; said Fred.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be right out,&#8221; exclaimed John as he struck
out with long powerful overhead strokes in the direction of the open
sea.</p>

<p>Grant and Fred clambered out upon the little ledge and began to put
on the few pieces of clothing that they possessed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly do feel fine,&#8221; exclaimed Fred as he took in
a deep breath of the pure air that was blown upon them straight up from
the waters of the sea. &#8220;The air is fine to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it ought to be, every day,&#8221; laughed Grant.
&#8220;After it has traveled a couple of thousand miles across the
water it ought to be pretty nearly pure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And have no dust in it,&#8221; added Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;Where&#8217;s
John?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see him,&#8221; said Fred, turning to look for
his companion. &#8220;I hope he didn&#8217;t try to swim out very far.
That&#8217;s always a fool trick, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; exclaimed Grant, somewhat alarmed at not
discovering his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is,&#8221; cried Fred suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why out there. Don&#8217;t you see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s crazy,&#8221; said Grant angrily. &#8220;Why does
he want to go so far out? He can swim just as well along shore and not
take half the risk. Suppose anything should happen to him now, we
couldn&#8217;t help him a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; cried Fred suddenly, &#8220;there&#8217;s a
shark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right behind John. He&#8217;s a goner now,&#8221; and Fred
almost sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;John! John!&#8221; shouted Grant at the top of his voice, but
he knew it was hopeless to think of making himself heard at that
distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone. He&#8217;s gone,&#8221; moaned Fred
distractedly.</p>

<p>The great black fin moved steadily along in back of the daring young
swimmer. To the boys on the shore it seemed as if it approached nearer
with every passing moment. Suddenly there was a great splashing in the
immediate vicinity of where John was swimming.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span
class='fss'>SHARK</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s horrible,&#8221; cried Fred almost beside himself
with anguish. &#8220;Oh, why did he swim out so far?&#8221;</p>

<p>The splashing continued. The two boys on the shore stood and watched
almost spellbound at the sight. Their faces were white and their hearts
were like great lumps in their throats. Neither one had any thought
other than that John had been attacked by the shark and was even now
being torn to pieces by the great man-eater. They shut their eyes to
hide the horror of the thing.</p>

<p>Finally Grant looked again. The splashing had ceased and the water
was calm around the spot where John had been. Suddenly he spied a head
appearing far out from the shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is,&#8221; he cried suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who? John?&#8221; demanded Fred. &#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out there in the same place. He hasn&#8217;t gotten him
yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the shark?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There it is,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;Between John and
the shore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sure enough, the great black fin appeared once more sailing serenely
about a few yards distant from John, but between him and land.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can he get in?&#8221; cried Fred. &#8220;The shark is in
the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;Certainly he
can&#8217;t swim right at the shark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He never will get in,&#8221; moaned Fred. &#8220;He&#8217;ll
surely be killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right so far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. He missed him before but he won&#8217;t
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe John can fight him off. You can&#8217;t
tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There he goes again. He&#8217;s closing in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shark did seem to be moving towards John once more. Around and
around in circles he went and even from the shore Grant and Fred could
see their companion&#8217;s head turn so as always to keep his eyes
fixed on his enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must go to him,&#8221; cried Fred. &#8220;We must do
something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can we do? We&#8217;re helpless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we swim out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose we did. We couldn&#8217;t do anything when we got
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly the splashing was resumed. John and the shark both
disappeared from sight as the water was thrown up in all directions
around them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened, Grant? I&#8217;m afraid to
look.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he drove him off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. There he is. He scared him away again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t keep that up forever, though,&#8221; moaned
Fred. &#8220;He must be getting pretty nearly exhausted by
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; cried Grant suddenly. &#8220;Here comes
Sam.&#8221;</p>

<p>Running towards them at top speed and throwing off his clothes as he
ran came Sam. In his teeth was the long knife he had made so
laboriously and spent so many hours to sharpen.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he going to do?&#8221; cried Fred in wonderment.
&#8220;Where are you going, Sam?&#8221; he called as the negro came up
to the spot where the two boys stood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&#8217;ll get &#8217;im,&#8221; muttered Sam, and without
waiting for another thing he plunged headlong into the water. A moment
later he reappeared, the knife still in his mouth, and with powerful
strokes struck out for John and the hungry giant that threatened
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he going to do, Grant?&#8221; exclaimed
Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Watch him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think he can kill the shark with that
knife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s evidently going to try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>John was perhaps a hundred and fifty yards from shore now. Slowly he
was nearing land and safety, but could he reach it? The great shark
still circled around and around the unfortunate boy, evidently waiting
for some moment when John should be off his guard to give him an
opportunity to strike. John was determined that this should not happen,
however, and he watched the shark just as closely as he himself was
watched. First he swam on one side and then on the other, then on his
back and then on his stomach. Not for a second did he relax his
watchfulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at Sam go!&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;He&#8217;s a
marvelous swimmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s that all right, but I wish he would get
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes the shark,&#8221; cried Grant, and as he spoke the
big fin could be seen to shoot with lightning-like rapidity in close to
the spot where John was. A great splashing immediately followed and
then the fin appeared once more some ten or twelve yards distant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! That was close,&#8221; gasped Grant, his lips ashen
with terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s getting desperate,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;He
knows that unless he can get John before he comes much closer to shore
his chance is gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry, Sam!&#8221; shouted Grant with all his strength.
&#8220;Keep it up, John!&#8221; he called. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be all
right in a minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will not,&#8221; said Fred in a low voice.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll be gone in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No he won&#8217;t,&#8221; cried Grant. &#8220;Sam is almost
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forty yards is a lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry, Sam! Hurry!&#8221; begged Grant. &#8220;You must
hurry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; cried Fred. &#8220;The shark must have seen him.
He&#8217;s going away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not &#8216;away,&#8217;&#8221; Grant corrected. &#8220;He&#8217;s
just backing up a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sure enough the shark moved out a little toward the ocean and the
fin stood almost still as if it might be debating what should be done
next. Evidently the arrival of a second foe had puzzled him. Sharks are
not known especially for their bravery. Rather they are scavengers that
feed on the ocean&#8217;s refuse, and they must be very hungry indeed
to attack a man unless they have him at a disadvantage. Grant and Fred
were aware of this fact, but they feared that this particular shark was
very hungry and that he did have John at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;ll go away now that there are two of
them,&#8221; said Fred hopefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure,&#8221; warned Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll attack soon if he&#8217;s going to,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;ll have to. The water gets pretty shallow in a
little closer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at Sam,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;He&#8217;s sending
John on ahead of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;John must be pretty tired now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be all right in a minute, though. A few more
yards and he&#8217;ll be out of danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes the shark again,&#8221; cried Fred suddenly.
&#8220;This is about his last chance and it won&#8217;t be so easy to
drive him off this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Around and around the two swimmers the shark circled. He moved with
amazing rapidity, and it seemed as if the two hard-pressed and tired
swimmers must become dizzy if they followed his every move.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll fly around them like that,&#8221; said Grant,
&#8220;until he sees a good chance and then you&#8217;ll see him strike
like lightning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They mustn&#8217;t give him a chance,&#8221; muttered Fred
doggedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t if they can help it, you may be sure of
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There he goes!&#8221; cried Fred. &#8220;No, not yet,&#8221;
he corrected himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll strike, all right. Just watch him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Sam can only use that knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he won&#8217;t attack Sam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re awfully close together now,&#8221; said Fred.
&#8220;If he goes for John, Sam can stick him and if he goes for Sam,
why he has the knife right there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old knife will never go through that shark&#8217;s
hide,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost as hard as sheet
steel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the test anyway,&#8221; cried Fred, and as he
spoke the giant fin could be seen darting suddenly towards the two
swimmers. Just before it reached them it disappeared beneath the
surface of the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has turned bottom side up to bite,&#8221; muttered Grant,
fully understanding just what was taking place.</p>

<p>Sam and John had noted the approach of their enemy and both realized
that the crisis of the whole affair was now at hand. If they could
elude him this once, the chances were that they could reach shallow
water where the shark would not dare to follow them. They both began to
kick violently and splash as much as possible with their hands; they
shouted and yelled; they did everything which they thought might
possibly aid them in scaring the great ugly fish away.</p>

<p>Grant and Fred on the shore held their breath while all this was
taking place and their hearts almost stopped beating. With feverish
anxiety they awaited the result of the battle taking place before their
very eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s John,&#8221; cried Grant suddenly.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s Sam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see him. I don&#8217;t see the shark
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The splashing has stopped. Sam must have been
killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;Don&#8217;t say that.
It can&#8217;t be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; cried Fred.</p>

<p>The water some five or ten yards behind John was suddenly churned
into froth. Red, bloody froth it was and evidently some gigantic
struggle was going on. All at once, just on the outside of the
miniature maelstrom, appeared a small round, black object.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Sam!&#8221; shouted Grant.</p>

<p>Sure enough. Sam was still alive and without wasting a moment he
struck out boldly for the shore. John was ahead of him, but he was soon
overhauled by the powerful negro and side by side the two swimmers
plowed through the sea. Behind them the waters were still churned by
the struggles of the great shark, but they were rapidly becoming
weaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sam killed the shark,&#8221; exclaimed Fred, almost overcome
by the suddenness and the unexpectedness of the event.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks so,&#8221; agreed Grant. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think
it was possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I. Imagine the nerve he had, and that old knife certainly
did do the work after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, John owes his life to Sam all right. He surely would
have been killed if he had been left out there alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a doubt of it. I don&#8217;t see how Sam managed
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find out in a minute. John must be about
exhausted too; Sam is helping him in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Want any help, you two?&#8221; called Fred to the two
swimmers who were rapidly approaching the shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thanks,&#8221; said John in reply. &#8220;Sam will get us
in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grant and Fred leaned far out over the water and extended their
hands to the two swimmers who were only a few feet distant now. A
moment later and they had drawn John up on the shore, where he lay
panting, his strength practically all used up. When they turned to
assist Sam, however, they found their negro friend clambering up
without the least bit of trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with your shoulder, Sam?&#8221;
exclaimed Grant in alarm.</p>

<p>The skin seemed to be all torn away and the blood was flowing freely
from Sam&#8217;s right shoulder. Just what had happened, it was
impossible to say.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='fss'>TALKING IT
OVER</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Dat,&#8221; said Sam, referring to Grant&#8217;s question
concerning his shoulder, &#8220;am wheah Ah come in too clost contack
wif dat sha&#8217;k.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he bite you?&#8221; exclaimed Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed. He jes&#8217; nachully done rub up again&#8217;
me, dat&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But just rubbing against you wouldn&#8217;t tear you up like
that,&#8221; protested Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am dat so? Ah don&#8217;t reckon yo&#8217; all evah seen a
sha&#8217;k at front han&#8217; ef yo&#8217; say dat. Have yo&#8217; evah
felt a sha&#8217;k&#8217;s skin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t. Is it rough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you evah felt san&#8217; paper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lots of times. Is it as rough as that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lawdy,&#8221; exclaimed Sam. &#8220;In compahson wif a
sha&#8217;k&#8217;s skin Ah tell yo&#8217; dat san&#8217; paper am lak
velvet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say it was rough, then,&#8221; laughed Fred.
&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t that hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must,&#8221; Grant broke in, &#8220;and it ought to be
attended to at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s nothin&#8217;,&#8221; said Sam carelessly.
&#8220;She&#8217;ll be all right soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Grant protested, &#8220;but just look at it
bleed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All de bettah. When she bleed lak dat dey&#8217;s no chance
ob poison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it ought to be stopped now. Come up by the spring where
there&#8217;s cold water and let me bathe it for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead, Sam,&#8221; urged John, looking up and speaking for
the first time since he had been brought ashore.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed Fred. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
stay here with John.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one need stay with me,&#8221; said John. &#8220;I&#8217;m
getting my wind back now and as soon as I get a little strength
I&#8217;ll be as good as ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What made you swim so far out anyway?&#8221; demanded
Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I guess I was crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were worse than that,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;You
were a fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me that; I know it myself now. We always do
when it&#8217;s too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can tell you one thing,&#8221; said Grant warmly.
&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t be here now if it hadn&#8217;t been for
Sam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right you are,&#8221; John agreed. &#8220;I certainly owe my
life to you, Sam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah guess mebbe Ah will bafe mah shouldah,&#8221; said Sam,
much embarrassed and ill at ease from all the compliments that were
being given him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll all go with you,&#8221; said John.
&#8220;I&#8217;m all right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll make Sam tell us how he did it,&#8221; added
Fred eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Sam,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;Tell
us all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; began Sam slowly, &#8220;Ah doan&#8217; know
jes&#8217; what dey is to tell. Ah jes&#8217; took dis heah knife wot
yo&#8217; all done make so much fun ob, an&#8217; Ah jes&#8217; stick
ol&#8217; mistah sha&#8217;k plum&#8217; in de belly wid it. Dat&#8217;s all
dey was to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Sam,&#8221; Fred protested, &#8220;how did you get close
enough to him? Did he attack you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah reckon as how he did do dat,&#8221; said Sam. &#8220;He
jes&#8217; came a swimmin&#8217; right at me and natchully dey was only
one thing foh me to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; laughed Grant, &#8220;but tell us how you
happened to get a good chance at him and not be bitten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When Ah seen dat sha&#8217;k a comin&#8217; at me,&#8221; continued
Sam, &#8220;Ah knowed dat he meant business. Ah took mah knife in mah
right han&#8217; an&#8217; Ah jes&#8217; sunk a tweeny bit below de
sufface ob de watah. He seen me an&#8217; he come right foh me too. Ah
waited foh him to turn belly up &#8217;cause Ah knowed dat what he &#8217;bliged to
do befoh he able to use dem razah teeth ob his&#8217;n. Sho&#8217; nuff
jes&#8217; befoh he reach me, ovah he go and den was mah chance. Ah
sho&#8217; did let &#8217;im have it an&#8217; Ah guess he ain&#8217;
gwine bothah no more peoples.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have been under water a long time,&#8221; remarked
Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so berry long,&#8221; said Sam. &#8220;Dat ol&#8217;
sha&#8217;k didn&#8217;t waste no time about what he doin&#8217; an&#8217;
yo&#8217; bet Ah didn&#8217;t neither.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess not,&#8221; laughed Grant. &#8220;When did he hit
your shoulder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right after Ah done stick &#8217;im. Soon&#8217;s Ah let
&#8217;im hab de knife he done commence thrashin&#8217; &#8217;round
somethin&#8217; terrible. &#8217;Fore Ah could get out ob his way he done hit
me a swipe wid dat ol&#8217; tail ob his an&#8217; dar yo&#8217; see
it.&#8221; Sam indicated his shoulder, which was still bleeding, though
not as freely as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all I can say is,&#8221; exclaimed Fred, &#8220;that
you ought to have a medal. I swear I don&#8217;t see how anyone could
have the nerve to fight a shark in the water. Why, I&#8217;d be afraid
of one lying half dead on the beach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So should I,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;How big was that
fellow anyway, John?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. He must have been nearly eighteen
feet though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on here,&#8221; said Fred skeptically, &#8220;you
can&#8217;t make us believe a thing like that. Eighteen feet; why,
that&#8217;s three times as long as you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it is. I realized that when I said it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he right, Sam?&#8221; demanded Fred. &#8220;Was the shark
as big as that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah should say he was jes&#8217; about dat size,&#8221;
replied Sam seriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; laughed Fred. &#8220;I won&#8217;t argue
with you, but that&#8217;s easily the biggest fish story I ever
heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the biggest fish I ever saw,&#8221; said John grimly.
&#8220;Whew!&#8221; and he shuddered at the recollection.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you think when you saw him first?&#8221; asked Grant
curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was nearly scared to death,&#8221; said John so solemnly
that everybody laughed. &#8220;I was swimming along easily and just
taking my time when I suddenly had a feeling that something was near
me. I looked around and sure enough, over the top of a little wave, I
saw that fin. I tell you it gave me the creeps and I honestly thought
my last day had come. I knew it was only a question of time before he
attacked me and I watched him pretty closely, I can tell you. All the
while I kept trying to get in nearer to shore, but I was afraid to swim
fast for I knew that if I did I couldn&#8217;t watch the shark and that
he would get me from behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A nice feeling,&#8221; remarked Fred grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say so. Well, in a minute I saw him coming and I
began to kick and splash with all my might. I didn&#8217;t think it
would be of any use, but I had to do something. Imagine my surprise
when I saw him veer away from me. I knew he&#8217;d be back though and
sure enough he was, and again I scared him away, but I knew it
couldn&#8217;t last forever. He was getting more determined and closer
to me each time and Sam got there none too soon I can tell
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you know what was happening, Sam?&#8221; demanded
Grant. &#8220;I thought you were on watch up by the flag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So Ah was. Ah could see jes&#8217; the same, couldn&#8217;t
Ah?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you could,&#8221; laughed Grant. &#8220;It&#8217;s
lucky you could too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe a ship has passed while we were down here,&#8221;
remarked Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fine chance,&#8221; said John skeptically. &#8220;No ships
ever pass here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This island reminds me of that old story about the farmer at
the circus,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;He looked at the giraffe for a
long time and then finally turned away in disgust. &#8216;Oh, shucks,&#8217;
he said, &#8216;there ain&#8217;t no such animal.&#8217; That&#8217;s the way
I feel about this island. There isn&#8217;t any such place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does seem so, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; laughed Fred.
&#8220;At any rate all the boats seem to avoid it. We may never get a
chance to use that signal.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the summit of the hill near the spot where George&#8217;s shirt
did duty as a flag the boys had prepared a great pile of driftwood. The
moment a ship was sighted this pyre was to be lighted to attract the
attention of those on board the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey&#8217;s plenty ob people wot would lak to find dis island
all right,&#8221; said Sam confidently. &#8220;Ah knows piles ob
sailors wot would gib dere eye teeth to see dis yere island wid de
sha&#8217;k rock on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we found it all right,&#8221; exclaimed Grant,
&#8220;and from the look of things it is just as hard for us to get
away from it as it is for most people to find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve done better than most of them anyway,&#8221; said
Fred. &#8220;We&#8217;ve found the island but we can&#8217;t find the
treasure. Most people can&#8217;t even find the island.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t done us any good so far,&#8221; said Grant.
&#8220;Now that we&#8217;re on this wonderful island what are we going
to do about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Solve the code,&#8221; replied Fred promptly. &#8220;Once
that is done the rest is easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same old cry,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;That code is
beginning to haunt my dreams. I think of it all day and I dream of it
all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;ll find the answer to it in a dream some
time,&#8221; suggested John.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I only could,&#8221; sighed Grant disconsolately.
&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he added, &#8220;let&#8217;s go back to the
cave. Have you fixed your shoulder up all right, Sam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It am as good as ebber,&#8221; replied Sam cheerily.</p>

<p>They made their way along the bank of the little stream that flowed
down from the spring. A soft breeze stirred the palm trees and the
tropical foliage was brilliant. It would have been difficult to find
any more beautiful spot than this little island, set like a jewel, on
the bosom of the sparkling sea. The spell of it affected every member
of the party and few words were spoken as they walked along.</p>

<p>Soon they came within sight of the cave.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Pop,&#8221; exclaimed John. &#8220;It&#8217;s
about time he got back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll certainly be excited when he hears about the
shark,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;I wish he had been there with
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been up to something himself probably,&#8221; said
Fred. &#8220;You can trust him for stirring things up, no matter where
he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess he has been up to something,&#8221; exclaimed
John. &#8220;Look at what he&#8217;s got up there.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class='fss'>A NEW
MEMBER</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; cried John excitedly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get
up there and see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you suppose he ever did it?&#8221; exclaimed Grant.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a great one, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scrambling and hustling up over the rocks George&#8217;s four
companions vied with one another as to who should be the first to reach
the cave. John&#8217;s long legs would ordinarily have won the race for
him, but he was weakened by the effects of his experience in the water,
and Grant outdistanced him. The rest were close behind, however, and
all arrived almost together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get it, Pop?&#8221; demanded Grant eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, down at the other end of the island,&#8221; said George
evasively.</p>

<p>His face was wreathed in smiles, however, and he was very proud of
his exploit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you did it,&#8221; exclaimed Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m clever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get funny,&#8221; warned Grant.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll take it out of you if you get fresh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t touch me now,&#8221; said George loftily.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the reason we can&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because if you do, I&#8217;ll&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence. Instead he leaped to his feet and
hanging on to one hand howled with pain. His friends, however, instead
of sympathizing with him, all with one accord shrieked delightedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; cried George feelingly. &#8220;He&#8217;s a good
biter all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He,&#8221; in this case referred to a small green parrot
which George had been holding in both hands. In some way it had
wriggled loose from his grasp and twisting its head around had taken a
good sized bit of flesh out of the back of his hand. This was the cause
of George&#8217;s pain and his friends&#8217; mirth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put a muzzle on him, Pop,&#8221; advised Fred.
&#8220;He&#8217;s dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He certainly is,&#8221; agreed George. &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid he&#8217;ll bite that string in half too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you catch him?&#8221; inquired Grant curiously.
&#8220;Did you put salt on his tail?&#8221;</p>

<p>George gave the speaker a scornful look. &#8220;I caught him,&#8221;
he replied, &#8220;because he has a broken wing and can&#8217;t fly
very well. It wasn&#8217;t any easy job, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did he break his wing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t ask him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, you&#8217;re getting awfully fresh,&#8221; exclaimed
Grant, pretending that he was angry. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you be serious
and tell us how you caught him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I can, I was walking down around the end of the
island when I spied this fellow on the ground. I went up close to him
and he just flopped up and down and evidently could use only one wing.
I saw right away that it was broken and decided right there and then
that he ought to belong to me. I chased him all around for I
don&#8217;t know how long and finally I grabbed him by the tail
feathers and hung on. It was no easy thing to do though and I can tell
you I nearly gave it up any number of times. Just as I&#8217;d get up
close to him and make a grab at him, he&#8217;d hop away and when I did
catch him he tried his best to bite me. He&#8217;s got plenty of spunk
all right,&#8221; and George looked ruefully at his bleeding hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to tame him?&#8221; asked John.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to do my best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think he&#8217;ll stay around here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will as long as he&#8217;s tied, that&#8217;s sure. I got
that string off that old tarpaulin; you know the one we had in the
life-boat when we left the <i>Josephine</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to clip his wings,&#8221; said Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it and I intend to, too. I was just waiting for some
of you fellows to come back and help me. Where have you been
anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>The whole story of John and the shark was related to George, who was
naturally very much interested in the account.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I&#8217;d been there to see it,&#8221; he exclaimed
ruefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t either,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;I saw it
all, but I can tell you I didn&#8217;t enjoy the experience very
much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; agreed Grant. &#8220;It was too harrowing for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose John had much fun either,&#8221; said
George. &#8220;As far as I can see Sam was the only one who got any
pleasure out of it at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about that, Sam?&#8221; demanded Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Ah didn&#8217;t mind it so powerful much,&#8221; grinned
Sam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you want to do it every day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah cain&#8217;t say as how Ah would. One ob dem sha&#8217;ks might
get me sometime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose the shark had swallowed John,&#8221; George remarked.
&#8220;He&#8217;s so tall and skinny that he never could have gotten
him down and there he&#8217;d stuck right in his throat. He&#8217;d
been worse than Jonah and the whale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to stand for that, Spike?&#8221; inquired Fred
mischievously, hoping to start an argument of some kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has to,&#8221; said George. &#8220;He has nothing to say
about the matter at all,&#8221; and he assumed a careless and
indifferent air.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I wasn&#8217;t so weak just now I certainly would make him
eat those words,&#8221; exclaimed John.</p>

<p>&#8220;You hear that?&#8221; demanded George. &#8220;It&#8217;s
always &#8216;if&#8217; with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you always pick on a man when he&#8217;s down,&#8221;
retorted John.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about me? Just look at the terrible wound I have on the
back of my hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Grant, &#8220;the parrot thought you were
bird seed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or a cracker,&#8221; added Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; cried George, pretending to be
greatly hurt. &#8220;You all always take sides against me. Still
it&#8217;s an even match at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;d better take some of that conceit out of
him, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; exclaimed Grant slowly advancing towards
George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I should say so,&#8221; cried Fred eagerly, and a
moment later George was at the bottom of a pile of four boys, three of
whom busied themselves with poking him in the ribs, jouncing up and
down on his stomach and in every other way possible making it just as
uncomfortable as they could for him.</p>

<p>Everyone was laughing and in good humor, however. Seldom it was that
any of these boys lost his temper, for they had learned long ago just
how foolish a proceeding that was. The one who gets angry is always
teased, but there is no satisfaction in plaguing a boy who ignores it
or gives as good as he receives and always keeps his temper under
control.</p>

<p>Finally George was released and all four boys rose to their feet
laughing and good natured. Sam had been a greatly interested spectator
of these proceedings and had enjoyed them greatly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;dey am jus&#8217; about as
bad as fightin&#8217; sha&#8217;ks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You notice it took three of them to do it though, don&#8217;t
you, Sam?&#8221; exclaimed George, weak from laughter and loss of
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Want some more?&#8221; demanded Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll come one at a time, I&#8217;m
willing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s de way,&#8221; exclaimed Sam. &#8220;One at a
time. Dat&#8217;s fair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll postpone it till to-morrow,&#8221; said Grant.
&#8220;I&#8217;m winded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re afraid of me,&#8221; taunted George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, go and play with your parrot,&#8221; exclaimed Fred.
&#8220;You&#8217;re a bird yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; demanded George. &#8220;I&#8217;d almost
forgotten him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is,&#8221; said Fred laughingly. &#8220;He looks
like a little old man sitting up there on that rock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right; don&#8217;t you worry about him,&#8221;
said George. &#8220;He&#8217;s my friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looked so when he ate the back of your hand off,&#8221;
laughed Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the way he shows his affection,&#8221;
exclaimed George. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t mean anything by
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s the case,&#8221; said Grant,
&#8220;I&#8217;m certainly glad he doesn&#8217;t care anything about
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Catch him, Pop,&#8221; urged John, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll
clip his wings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you help me? I don&#8217;t want to lose him now after
all the trouble I had to get him. I think I can tame him,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure you can. Get him over here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you,&#8221; exclaimed John. &#8220;Watch
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seized hold of the string that was tied around the parrot&#8217;s
leg and began to haul in hand over hand. The poor bird fluttered and
struggled indignantly but all to no avail. He was quickly pulled along
until he was at John&#8217;s feet when George grabbed him and held him
securely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now how can we cut his wings?&#8221; demanded Fred. &#8220;We
have no scissors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have knives, haven&#8217;t we?&#8221; exclaimed
George.</p>

<p>&#8220;But are they sharp enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am mine,&#8221; said Sam. &#8220;It suttinly done fix dat
sha&#8217;k all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s a little too big for a parrot
though,&#8221; laughed Grant. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think
so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;P&#8217;raps it am,&#8221; admitted Sam. &#8220;It&#8217;s
sho&#8217; a good knife dough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spread his wings out on the rock here,&#8221; directed John.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll cut the tips off his feathers so he can&#8217;t fly
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hurt him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No danger of that. You just hold him still.&#8221;</p>

<p>The operation was quickly performed and a few moments later the
little green bird was angrily stalking away, shaking his ruffled
feathers and uttering indignant squawks at every step.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at him,&#8221; laughed Grant. &#8220;My, but he&#8217;s
mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So would you be,&#8221; said George. &#8220;Imagine being
treated like that by someone about a hundred times as big as you
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would rouse me a little,&#8221; admitted Grant.
&#8220;What are you going to name him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. What&#8217;s a good name,
anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Call him Snip,&#8221; suggested Fred. &#8220;He certainly
took a snip out of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good one,&#8221; exclaimed George. &#8220;His
name is Snip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to teach him his name now, Pop,&#8221; said
Grant. &#8220;That&#8217;ll give you something to do and keep you out
of mischief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want him to talk, too,&#8221; said George, &#8220;and I
want him to get so tame that he&#8217;ll ride around on my shoulder
wherever I go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;ll peck your eye out,&#8221; said John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess not. He&#8217;ll be all right after a
while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you going to go about teaching him to talk?&#8221;
demanded John. &#8220;I suppose he&#8217;ll have to learn the alphabet
first,&#8221; and he nudged Grant as he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, of course,&#8221; laughed George sarcastically.
&#8220;You&#8217;re all pretty smart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Pop,&#8221; said John, soothingly, &#8220;it
wouldn&#8217;t take long. There are only twenty-six letters in
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say?&#8221; cried Grant, suddenly springing to
his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said there were twenty-six letters in the
alphabet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hooray!&#8221; shouted Grant, and he began to dance around
like a wild man. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got it. I&#8217;ve got it,&#8221; he
repeated excitedly over and over again.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class='fss'>A
CLUE</span></h2>

<p>Grant&#8217;s companions sat and looked at him in amazement not
unmixed with alarm. They could see no reason for his strange behavior
and were at a complete loss what to make of it. They watched their
comrade execute a war dance around the entrance to the cave for some
moments and finally disappear within, uttering one last triumphant
whoop.</p>

<p>&#8220;What struck him?&#8221; exclaimed John in perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone crazy I guess,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t think of anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah believe yo&#8217; am right,&#8221; said Sam in a hollow
voice. &#8220;Ef he try to mess me up Ah sho&#8217; gwine use dis
knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put that away, Sam,&#8221; said John, sharply.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But ef he&#8217;s crazy,&#8221; protested Sam, &#8220;Ah
suttinly boun&#8217; proteck mahself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not crazy,&#8221; exclaimed George.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll be out in a minute and tell us just what is wrong
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and see what he&#8217;s doing, Pop,&#8221; urged Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not. He said he&#8217;d got it and he might get me,
too. What do you suppose he was talking about anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here he comes now. Ask him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grant emerged from the cave, his manner showing how excited he was.
He walked rapidly and his hands shook with nervousness. He carried the
piece of parchment that had become so familiar to the four boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have meant the code,&#8221; whispered Fred to
George.</p>

<p>&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t have solved it,&#8221; said George in a low
voice. &#8220;How could he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. At any rate he may have had an
idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grant advanced rapidly towards the spot where his companions were
grouped and seated himself in front of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on, Grant?&#8221; demanded John
curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a minute and I&#8217;ll show you something,&#8221; and
he spread the code out on the ground while the rest of the little party
peered eagerly over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, first of all,&#8221; began Grant, &#8220;you all know
what this is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a combination to a safe,&#8221; said George
readily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep quiet, Pop,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;Give him a
chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a code,&#8221; said Grant, ignoring George&#8217;s
facetious remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;We know that,&#8221; agreed Fred. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be so
mysterious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the highest number in it?&#8221; demanded
Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;He sounds like a trick man,&#8221; laughed George
jeeringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No treasure for Pop,&#8221; said Grant shortly.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the highest number in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll have to do it this way,&#8221; said John
with a sigh. &#8220;Let me see,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I guess
twenty-five is the highest number.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. How many letters are there in the
alphabet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-six.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Grant,&#8221; Fred protested, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see
what you&#8217;re getting at?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will soon enough. Just have a little patience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why don&#8217;t you tell us what your idea is right
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I don&#8217;t want to. At any rate it&#8217;s only an
idea and I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s right or not and I
haven&#8217;t worked it out myself. That&#8217;s what we are doing now
and I want you all to help me. The whole thing may be wrong, but it
sounds pretty good to me. John&#8217;s remark about the number of
letters in the alphabet gave me the idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I ought to get the credit if we solve the code,&#8221;
exclaimed John.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be lucky if you don&#8217;t get shot,&#8221;
said George. &#8220;You ought to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead with your explanation, Grant,&#8221; urged Fred.
&#8220;Everybody keep quiet and give him a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;We&#8217;ve noticed that
the highest number is twenty-five and that there are twenty-six letters
in the alphabet, haven&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have,&#8221; said John so solemnly that George giggled
outright. His friends, however, were in a very serious mood and he
quickly realized that his hilarity was decidedly out of place.</p>

<p>&#8220;What number appears most frequently?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess fourteen does,&#8221; said Fred after a hasty survey
of the figures spread out on the ground before them.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, five,&#8221; exclaimed John. &#8220;There are a good many
more fives than there are fourteens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps there are,&#8221; Fred admitted. &#8220;Go ahead,
Grant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grant made some calculations that his comrades could not follow
before he replied to Fred&#8217;s remark. His friends eyed him
curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose we put the letter <i>e</i> wherever the number five
occurs,&#8221; he said at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do that for?&#8221; demanded George,
now very much interested in the experiment Grant was conducting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind why,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;Do as I
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me a sheet out of your diary, Pop,&#8221; said Fred.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll do the figuring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to write it all down?&#8221; inquired
George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I, Grant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put it all down. We&#8217;ll go slowly, but we&#8217;ll do it
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;Here goes,&#8221;
and he wrote as follows, substituting the letter for the number every
time he came to it:</p>

<p>20 - 1 - 11 - e - 1 - 3 - 15 - 21 - 18 - 19 - e - 4 - 21 - e - 14 - 15 - 18 - 20 - 8 - 15 - 14 - e - 8 - 21 - 14 - 18 - e - 4 - 6 - e - e - 20 - 6 - 18 - 15 - 13 - 20 - 8 - e - 19 - 15 - 21 - 20 - 8 - e - 18 - 14 - e - 24 - 20 - 18 - e - 13 - 9 - 20 - 25 - 15 - 6 - 19 - 8 - 1 - 18 - 11 - 18 - 15 - 3 - 11 - 20 - 8 - e - 14 - e - 1 - 19 - 20 - 6 - 9 - 6 - e - e - 20 - 1 - 14 - 4 - 14 - 15 - 18 - 20 - 8 - 2 - 25 - e - 1 - 19 - 20 - 20 - 8 - 9 - 18 - 20 - 25 - 20 - 8 - 18 - e - e - 4 - 9 - 7.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; exclaimed George when Fred had finished,
&#8220;it may be very simple and all that, but it doesn&#8217;t mean
anything to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, not yet,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;Have a little
patience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you tell us what your system is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about fourteen now?&#8221; demanded Fred. &#8220;We
decided that was a pretty common number, you know. What shall I do with
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; said Grant and once again he
appeared to calculate something in his head. &#8220;In place of
fourteen put the letter <i>n</i>,&#8221; he directed, &#8220;and use
the copy you just made.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by the copy I just made?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean leave the letter <i>e</i> where you put it in the last
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we go,&#8221; exclaimed Fred and this is what he
wrote:</p>

<p>20 - 1 - 11 - e - 1 - 3 - 15 - 21 - 18 - 19 - e - 4 - 21 - e - n - 15 - 18 - 20 - 8 - 15 - n - e - 8 - 21 - n - 4 - 18 - e - 4 - 6 - e - e - 20 - 6 - 18 - 15 - 13 - 20 - 8 - e - 19 - 15 - 21 - 20 - 8 - e - 18 - n - e - 24 - 20 - 18 - e - 13 - 9 - 20 - 25 - 15 - 6 - 19 - 8 - l - 18 - 11 - 18 - 15 - 3 - 11 - 20 - 8 - e - n - e - 1 - 19 - 20 - 6 - 9 - 6 - 20 - 25 - 6 - e - e - 20 - 1 - n - 4 - n - 15 - 18 - 20 - 8 - 2 - 25 - e - 1 - 19 - 20 - 20 - 8 - 9 - 18 - 20 - 25 - 20 - 8 - 18 - e - e - 4 - 9 - 7.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clear as mud,&#8221; cried George, slapping Fred heartily on
the back. &#8220;You&#8217;re a wonder, Peewee, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must confess I don&#8217;t understand all this
business,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you tell us
what you are trying to do, Grant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m not sure that I know myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us what you think anyway,&#8221; urged John.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no harm in that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;If you
fellows don&#8217;t want to help me any more though, I&#8217;m
perfectly willing to work it out by myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;If
there&#8217;s anything going to happen around here I want to be on
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; me too,&#8221; said Sam eagerly. &#8220;Ah wants to
be heah when dat treasah am discovahed. Ah&#8217;ll fix dem niggers in
Richmond yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good boy, Sam,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;You and I will
work it out together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah cain&#8217;t read nor write,&#8221; said Sam
disconsolately. &#8220;Ah&#8217;s afraid Ah wouldn&#8217;t be ob bery
much help to yo&#8217;. Ah can suttingly do some diggin&#8217;
dough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to stay along; don&#8217;t worry about
that,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;I wish Grant would tell us what
he&#8217;s trying to do, but I&#8217;m going to stay by him whether he
tells or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what he&#8217;s trying to do,&#8221; said George.
&#8220;It&#8217;s simple enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it then?&#8221; demanded Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, he thinks these numbers are used in place of letters. A
certain number means a certain letter and wherever he sees it he
substitutes the letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We all know that much,&#8221; cried John scornfully.
&#8220;What we want to know is how he figures out what letter to put in
place of a certain number. Can you tell us that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t,&#8221; George admitted ruefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you don&#8217;t know how he does it, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t. That is, not yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead then, Grant,&#8221; exclaimed John.
&#8220;We&#8217;re wasting time here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to go on with it, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grant picked up the code and studied it attentively for some
moments. Finally he put it down again. &#8220;Suppose we put the letter
<i>h</i> in place of the figure eight,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Eight
seems to be a fairly common number.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once again Fred copied the mysterious set of numbers, making the
change that Grant had suggested.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<p>When Fred had completed his task the following result appeared:</p>

<p>20 - 1 - 11 - e - 1 - 3 - 15 - 21 - 18 - 19 - e - 4 - 25 - e - n - 15 - 18 - 20 - h - 15 - n - e - h - 21 - n - 4 - 18 - e - 4 - 6 - e - e - 20 - 6 - 18 - 15 - 13 - 2 - h - e - 19 - 15 - 21 - 20 - h - e - 18 - n - e - 24 - 20 - 18 - e - 13 - 9 - 20 - 25 - 15 - 6 - 19 - h - 1 - 18 - 11 - 18 - 15 - 3 - 11 - 20 - h - e - n - e - 1 - 19 - 20 - 6 - 9 - 6 - 20 - 25 - 6 - e - e - 20 - 1 - n - 4 - n - 15 - 18 - 20 - h - 2 - 25 - e - 1 - 19 - 20 - 20 - h - 9 - 18 - 20 - 25 - 20 - h - 18 - e - e - 4 - 9 - 7.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it coming out all right, Grant?&#8221; asked John.
&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look like very much to me just yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t spell any words yet,&#8221; said Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, it certainly does,&#8221; exclaimed Grant.
&#8220;There&#8217;s <i>he</i> a couple of times. That spells
something, doesn&#8217;t it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that does,&#8221; admitted Fred, &#8220;but what can
<i>n-e-h</i> be? I never heard of that word or <i>e-n-e</i>
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must remember that it isn&#8217;t all done yet by a good
deal,&#8221; Grant protested. &#8220;You see we&#8217;ve substituted
only three letters so far and it spells two words already. I call that
pretty good work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and in a minute you may run up against a snag and find
that you&#8217;re all wrong,&#8221; said George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; admitted Grant. &#8220;If my system is
wrong we&#8217;ll find it out pretty soon, too. It seems to me to be
worth trying though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I think so, too,&#8221; exclaimed Fred readily.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s try another now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t you substitute two at once?&#8221; said John.
&#8220;That would save a lot of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it would,&#8221; admitted Grant. &#8220;It would also
double the chances of mistakes and we don&#8217;t want to make any if
we can help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be careful,&#8221; said George. &#8220;Go into
another trance, Grant, and tell us two letters this time. You&#8217;re
a regular Hindoo fakir and for all I know you may have hypnotized the
whole crowd of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Pop! Be serious,&#8221; exclaimed John.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am serious and I&#8217;m just as anxious to solve this as
you are. You don&#8217;t mind if I get a little fun out of it though,
do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got the letters, Grant?&#8221; demanded Fred of the owner of
the secret, who was busily engaged in more calculations. His eyes were
half shut and he did a great deal of counting on his fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ssh,&#8221; hissed George softly, but no one noticed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Grant suddenly. &#8220;Put <i>r</i> in
place of eighteen and <i>t</i> in place of twenty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got your system,&#8221; exclaimed John all at
once. &#8220;I had an idea before and now I&#8217;m quite sure of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, String?&#8221; inquired George eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t tell you. Wait and see if I&#8217;m
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you said you were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell him, String, if you know,&#8221; urged
Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t; don&#8217;t worry about that. Isn&#8217;t it
simple?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just like you,&#8221; muttered George, but no one heeded
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead, Fred,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;Write it out
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Fred had complied the code had the following
appearance,&#8211;</p>

<p>t - 1 - 11 - e - 1 - 3 - 15 - 21 - r - 19 - e - 4 - 21 - e - n - 15 - 4 - t - h - 15 - n - e - h - 21 - n - 4 - r - e - 4 - 6 - e - e - t - 6 - r - 15 - 13 - t - h - e - 19 - 15 - 21 - t - h - e - r - n - e - 24 - t - r - e - 13 - 9 - t - 25 - 15 - 6 - 19 - h - 1 - r - 11 - r - 15 - 3 - 11 - t - h - e - n - e - 1 - 19 - t - 6 - 9 - 6 - t - 25 - 6 - e - e - t - 1 - n - 4 - n - 15 - r - t - h - 2 - 25 - e - 1 - 19 - t - t - h - 9 - r - t - 25 - t - h - r - e - e - 4 - 9 - 7.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve got more letters in it than you had
anyway,&#8221; exclaimed George, &#8220;and right down at the end there
it spells the word <i>three</i>. Grant, I believe you may be on the
right track after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, we&#8217;ll all be rich soon,&#8221; exclaimed
John. &#8220;Just think of us going home with great bags of gold and
jewels slung over each shoulder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; cried Sam, his eyes sparkling and his ivory teeth
showing in a dazzling smile. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t dat be
great?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See any ships coming to rescue us?&#8221; said John.
&#8220;Who wants to be rescued anyway? We&#8217;re going to find the
gold; we&#8217;re going to find the gold!&#8221; and he danced joyously
around, waving his arms about his head while he chanted over and over
again the same refrain, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to find the gold;
we&#8217;re going to find the gold!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re a little previous,
String,&#8221; laughed Grant, looking up from the code which he had
been studying intently. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t got it yet, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we shall,&#8221; insisted John joyously.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll find it all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s keep at it,&#8221; exclaimed Fred.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the best way I know to accomplish anything. Talking
about it doesn&#8217;t do much good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give him a couple more letters then, Grant,&#8221; exclaimed
George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me give him one,&#8221; said John. &#8220;See if I can
guess right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Grant, &#8220;you try it this time and
see if you know the trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me two,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;We worked two at a time
before and we ought to be able to do it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What numbers do you want letters for?&#8221; inquired
John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; mused Fred. &#8220;How about eleven and
fifteen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a second now,&#8221; and John began to calculate and
count on his fingers just as Grant had done.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another fakir,&#8221; whispered George, but as usual no one
paid the slightest attention to him. Every one was intent upon the code
and too much interested in it to be diverted by anything else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put <i>k</i> in place of eleven, and <i>o</i> in place of
fifteen,&#8221; said John after he had apparently satisfied himself as
to the correctness of his calculations. &#8220;Is that correct,
Grant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;You know the system all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might tell us,&#8221; exclaimed George enviously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep quiet, Pop, and watch me,&#8221; ordered Fred, and once
more he rewrote the code while his companions watched him eagerly. This
is what he wrote:</p>

<p>t - 1 - k - e - 1 - 3 - o - 21 - r - 19 - e - 4 - 21 - e - n - o - r - t - h - o - n - e - h - 21 - n - 4 - r - e - 4 - 6 - e - e - t - 6 - r - o - 13 - t - h - e - 19 - o - 31 - t - h - e - r - n - e - 24 - t - r - e - 13 - t - 25 - o - 6 - 19 - h - 1 - r - k - r - o - e - k - t - h - e - n - e - 1 - 19 - t - 6 - 9 - 6 - t - 25 - 6 - e - e - t - 1 - n - 4 - n - o - r - t - h - 2 - 25 - e - 1 - 19 - t - t - h - 9 - r - t - 25 - t - h - r - e - e - 4 - 9 - 7.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re getting rid of the numbers fast enough
anyway,&#8221; exclaimed George. &#8220;It looks like Greek to me
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s written in some foreign language,&#8221;
suggested Fred. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that be awful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s Finnish,&#8221; said George. &#8220;We got
it from a Finn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey&#8217;s always ha&#8217;d luck,&#8221; exclaimed Sam
soberly. &#8220;Ef some Finn done wrote dat we don&#8217;t stan&#8217;
no chance ob eber findin&#8217; de treasah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean it will be our finish, is that it?&#8221; laughed
George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah wouldn&#8217;t be at all s&#8217;prised,&#8221; said Sam
solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you think it&#8217;s not written in
English?&#8221; demanded Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, just look along there in the middle,&#8221; said
George. &#8220;It says r-k-r-o, and then k-t-h-e-n-e. Did you ever hear
of any words that sounded like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but towards the end it spells two words
distinctly,&#8221; protested Grant, &#8220;Just see there, n-o-r-t-h,
and t-h-r-e-e. Certainly they spell <i>north</i> and <i>three</i>,
don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They do,&#8221; admitted George. &#8220;That&#8217;s what
puzzles me. Part of it seems to be all right and part wrong. Are you
sure your system is right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet, but I&#8217;m getting surer all the time. How about
you, String?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with you, Grant. We&#8217;ll have it all in a
minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s written in two languages,&#8221; said Fred.
&#8220;Sometimes they do a thing like that, you know, to make it all
the harder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a cheerful soul,&#8221; exclaimed Grant grimly.
&#8220;If it&#8217;s written in two languages we&#8217;ll be about as
badly off as we were before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we shan&#8217;t know whether we&#8217;re right or
not,&#8221; added George.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say go ahead anyway the way we have been doing,&#8221;
exclaimed Fred. &#8220;We seem to be making some sort of
progress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us what letter corresponds to number one,&#8221; said
George.</p>

<p>&#8220;A,&#8221; almost shouted John and Grant together.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to agree on that at any rate,&#8221; laughed George.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you tell us what your system is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think you&#8217;d have guessed it by this
time,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s just as simple as
rolling off a log.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, of course,&#8221; said George sarcastically.
&#8220;Everything is when you know all about it. I think you might let
Fred and me into your secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One stands for <i>a</i>,&#8221; was Grant&#8217;s reply.
&#8220;Nineteen stands for <i>s</i>. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll tell
you now. Go ahead and put those down if you want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Write it down, Fred,&#8221; said George sorrowfully.
&#8220;My,&#8221; he added under his breath, &#8220;I hate stingy
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Fred wrote:&#8211;</p>

<p>t - a - k - e - a - 3 - o - 21 - r - s - e - 4 - 21 - e - n - o - r - t - h - o - n - e - h - 21 - n - 4 - r - e - 4 - 6 - e - e - t - 6 - r - o - 13 - t - h - e - s - o - 21 - t - h - e - r - n - e - 24 - t - r - e - 13 - 9 - t - 25 - o - 6 - s - h - a - r - k - o - 3 - k - t - h - e - n - e - a - s - t - 6 - 9 - 6 - t - 25 - 6 - e - e - t - a - n - 4 - n - e - r - t - h - 2 - 25 - e - a - s - t - t - h - 9 - r - t - 25 - t - h - r - e - e - 4 - 9 - 7.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep it up,&#8221; urged George. &#8220;Let&#8217;s not
discuss it any more until it is all written out. Give him some more
letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take <i>u</i> for twenty-one and <i>f</i> for six,&#8221;
said Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me three this time,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;There
aren&#8217;t many left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Take <i>i</i> for nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more Fred wrote it out as follows:</p>

<p>t - a - k - e - a - 3 - o - u - r - s - e - 4 - u - e - n - o - r - t - h - o - n - e - h - u - n - 4 - r - e - 4 - f - e - e - t - f - r - o - 13 - t - h - e - s - o - u - t - h - e - r - n - e - 24 - t - r - e - 13 - i - t - 25 - o - f - s - h - a - r - k - r - o - 3 - k - t - h - e - n - e - a - s - t - f - i - f - t - 25 - f - e - e - t - a - n - 4 - n - o - r - t - h - 2 - 25 - e - a - s - t - t - h - e - r - t - 25 - t - h - r - e - e - 4 - i - 7.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way,&#8221; cried George. &#8220;Give him
some more. Clean it up this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see,&#8221; said Grant musingly. &#8220;What
numbers are left?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three, four, thirteen, twenty-four, twenty-five, two and
seven,&#8221; said George. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; exclaimed Grant, &#8220;we&#8217;ll finish
it up. Go ahead, Fred, and in place of three put <i>c</i>, in place of
four <i>d</i>, put <i>m</i> for thirteen, <i>x</i> for twenty-four,
<i>y</i> for twenty-five, <i>b</i> for two, and let&#8217;s see,
<i>g</i> for seven. That ought to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here I go,&#8221; said Fred, beginning to write at once.
&#8220;You tell me what to do when I come to those numbers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grant prompted him and the whole code of numbers was soon translated
into letters, reading as follows in its final form:</p>

<p>t - a - k - e - a - c - o - u - r - s - e - d - u - e - n - o - r - t - h - o - n - e - h - u - n - d - r - e - d - f - e - e - t - f - r - o - m - t - h - e - s - o - u - t - h - e - r - n - e - x - t - r - e - m - i - t - y - o - f - s - h - a - r - k - r - o - c - k - t - h - e - n - e - a - s - t - f - i - f - t - y - f - e - e - t - a - n - d - n - o - r - t - h - b - y - e - a - s - t - t - h - i - r - t - y - t - h - r - e - e - d - i - g.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_24'></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br /><span
class='fss'>SOLVED</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;There it is,&#8221; exclaimed Fred when he had finished
writing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it say?&#8221; demanded George. &#8220;It&#8217;s
certainly jumbled up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll start at the beginning,&#8221; said Grant
eagerly, &#8220;and spell out the letters and see if we can&#8217;t
make words out of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Read them out loud,&#8221; suggested Fred, &#8220;and go
slow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;T,&#8221; began Grant, &#8220;that doesn&#8217;t spell
anything. T-a; T-a-k; T-a-k-e.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take,&#8221; exclaimed George. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; cried John. &#8220;Go ahead from there,
Grant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A,&#8221; said Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a word,&#8221; cried Fred. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
got &#8216;take a,&#8217; so far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;C,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;C-o; C-o-u; C-o-u-r.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That means &#8216;heart&#8217; in French,&#8221; exclaimed George.
&#8220;The next three letters, s-e-d, mean &#8216;but&#8217; in French. Do
you suppose that could be right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make sense that way,&#8221; said John. &#8216;Take
a heart but.&#8217; What does that mean?&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps every word doesn&#8217;t count,&#8221; George
suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;What does
c-o-u-r-s-e spell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course, of course,&#8221; said John laughingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly it does,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
word we want. So far we have three; &#8216;take a course.&#8217;
Doesn&#8217;t that sound more like it to you fellows than some sort of
French that George is trying to bring into it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; said Fred with great conviction.
&#8220;&#8216;Take a course&#8217; is right, and the next word is d-u-e,
due.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Correct,&#8221; cried Grant. &#8220;Why, this is easy. Just
see if I can&#8217;t read the whole thing right off now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try it anyway,&#8221; said John. &#8220;Take it
slow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grant studied the letters in front of him for some moments in
silence. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got it,&#8221; he exclaimed at length.
&#8220;Just listen to this,&#8221; and he began to read slowly,
&#8220;&#8216;Take a course due north one hundred feet from the
south&#8211;&#8217;&#8221; he paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the southern, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; queried John.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. &#8216;Take a course due north one hundred feet
from the southern extremity of shark rock, then east fifty feet and
north by east thirty-three dig.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Correct,&#8221; cried John, &#8220;only you ought to have
read the last of it like this: &#8216;and north by east thirty-three.
Dig!&#8221; and he shouted the final word with all his might.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to find the gold, we&#8217;re going to find
the gold!&#8221; shouted Fred, borrowing John&#8217;s chant, and a
moment later every one in the little party had joined hands and was
dancing joyously about singing and laughing and shouting. Finally they
stopped from sheer exhaustion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Read dat again, will yo&#8217;?&#8221; demanded Sam
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Read it, Grant,&#8221; shouted George. &#8220;We&#8217;re
going to find the gold, we&#8217;re going to find the gold!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll keep quiet a minute I&#8217;ll read
it,&#8221; said Grant, and while every one listened with rapt attention
he read again the words it had taken them so many days and weeks to
discover. &#8220;&#8216;Take a course due north one hundred feet from the
southern extremity of shark rock, then east fifty feet and north by
east thirty-three. Dig.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, I just happened to think,&#8221; exclaimed Fred in
dismay. &#8220;How are we going to get those directions right? How can
we tell north from south except in a general sort of way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fred,&#8221; said George, pretending to be greatly
disappointed in his comrade, &#8220;how long will it take you to learn
that whenever anything is needed, I am the one who always has it?
Don&#8217;t you know that I always wear a compass and don&#8217;t you
remember Captain Dodge on board the <i>Josephine</i> complimenting me
on the fact one time? You are a great trial to me, Fred,&#8221; and
George shook his head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve got it anyway,&#8221; said
Fred shortly. &#8220;I still don&#8217;t see, though, how we are going
to measure distances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be hard,&#8221; admitted Grant. &#8220;How long are
your feet, String?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A yard and a half,&#8221; said George readily, and
immediately ducked to escape a blow aimed in his direction by the owner
of the feet in question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten inches,&#8221; replied John. &#8220;That is, my shoes are
just exactly that long, for I remember measuring them in the gymnasium
just before I left home. They&#8217;re in the cave if you want
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;It&#8217;s too late to do
anything to-day, anyway, and it&#8217;ll be dark in a little while. If
your shoes are exactly ten inches long though, we can measure with them
and figure out the distance easy enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure that the shark rock the code speaks of is the
one on the end of the island here?&#8221; exclaimed Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sho&#8217; it am,&#8221; said Sam. &#8220;Dey nevah was two
rocks lak dat one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed Fred. &#8220;It
must be the one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly it is,&#8221; said John. &#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t
have found two codes on this island unless the spot they referred to
was here too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s the rock all right,&#8221; said Grant
confidently. &#8220;I wish we could start right down there now, but I
suppose it would be foolish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ve done enough for one day anyhow,&#8221;
said John. &#8220;As long as we have solved the code we can&#8217;t
have much to complain of for one day&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t told us how you did it yet,&#8221; said
George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you found out for yourself? My, but
you&#8217;re dull.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I am,&#8221; admitted George. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
see it though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; added Fred. &#8220;Tell us how you did
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many letters are there in the alphabet?&#8221; asked
Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-six,&#8221; said George.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the first letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the second?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;B.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the third?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;C.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the twenty-sixth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Z.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know your alphabet anyway,&#8221; laughed Grant.
&#8220;Now this is how the code works; <i>a</i> is the first letter so
we call it one, <i>b</i> is the second so we call that two, and so on
all the way through. For instance, the letter <i>s</i> would be number
nineteen, and <i>t</i> would be twenty. Do you see the idea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I see that,&#8221; said George. &#8220;Explain the
rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s just this. Wherever number one came we put
the letter <i>a</i>. If number thirteen appeared we&#8217;d substitute
the thirteenth letter in the alphabet in its place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which would be <i>m</i>,&#8221; said George after a little
calculation on his fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;Now do you
see how it was done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. Isn&#8217;t that simple?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It took us long enough to find it out though,&#8221; said
John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I should say so,&#8221; exclaimed George.
&#8220;Weren&#8217;t we stupid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;The simplest
things are often the hardest to explain. Of course when you get the key
the rest is easy enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;According to this code then,&#8221; said Fred, &#8220;one,
two, three would be <i>a, b, c</i>. Is that right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Grant, &#8220;and twenty-four, twenty-five
and twenty-six would be <i>x, y, z</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t have
a number higher than twenty-six in this code then, could
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. There are only that many letters in the
alphabet, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you ever happen to think of it, Grant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess I&#8217;d thought of about everything else
possible,&#8221; laughed Grant. &#8220;When I heard Pop talking about
teaching his parrot the alphabet and somebody said there were
twenty-six letters in it, I got an idea all of a sudden. I knew those
figures backwards and forwards and I remembered that twenty-five was
the highest number in it. That would mean that twenty-six stood for the
letter z, but that is so uncommon anyway that it didn&#8217;t seem
strange that it should be missing. It was a new idea and it struck me
right away as being a good one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly was,&#8221; exclaimed George. &#8220;We ought to
give you a medal, Grant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t a gold piece do?&#8221; laughed Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sho&#8217; would suit me,&#8221; grinned Sam. &#8220;Ah
does want one ob dem dere diamon&#8217; ho&#8217;seshoes, dough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, when you get enough gold pieces you can buy one,&#8221;
said Grant. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think your friends back home would
be jealous of you though?&#8221; and he winked slyly at his
companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah suttinly does hope so,&#8221; exclaimed Sam heartily.
&#8220;Dey&#8217;s a lot of good fo&#8217; nothin&#8217; no &#8217;count
niggers anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you work any more if you had a lot of money?&#8221;
asked George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Work!&#8221; exclaimed Sam disdainfully. &#8220;Hello, dere,
foolish! What yo&#8217; think Ah am anyhow? To&#8217; must think
Ah&#8217;m plumb crazy,&#8221; and Sam looked pityingly at George.
&#8220;Ob co&#8217;se Ah wouldn&#8217;t nebber lif&#8217; mah han&#8217;
agin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you&#8217;d get tired of doing
nothing?&#8221; laughed George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jes&#8217; lemme try it onct,&#8221; and Sam snorted at the
idea of any one being so silly as to work unless he was compelled to do
so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you do get rich, Sam,&#8221; exclaimed John,
&#8220;and I hope all the rest of us do too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dis am de place fo&#8217; it,&#8221; said Sam confidently.
&#8220;Jes&#8217; think how many people would gib dere eyes jes&#8217;
to fin&#8217; dis yere island.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Finding the island wouldn&#8217;t do them much good unless
they knew where to look after they got here,&#8221; said Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we do know,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;All we have to
do now is to make a few measurements and do a little
digging.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be a good deal of digging,&#8221; said Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know how deep the stuff is buried, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we don&#8217;t care,&#8221; said George. &#8220;I&#8217;d
dig all the way to China to get that stuff if it was
necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we had some tools,&#8221; sighed John. &#8220;It may
be slow work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said George. &#8220;It&#8217;s
all sand down around that end of the island and we can use sticks and
anything we can get hold of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; mah knife,&#8221; added Sam eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Grant. &#8220;That knife will help a
lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can get Snip to use his beak on the tough spots,&#8221;
suggested Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; laughed George. &#8220;By the way he dug into my
hand he ought to be able to tear holes in the ground without any
trouble at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get to sleep,&#8221; said Grant, &#8220;and at
the crack of dawn to-morrow we&#8217;ll be down at the old shark rock
with our compass and String&#8217;s shoe ready to make ourselves
wealthy.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was an excited little party that turned in presently and dreamed
of gold and treasure unheard of all the rest of the warm tropical
night.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_25'></a>CHAPTER XXV<br /><span class='fss'>ON THE
BEACH</span></h2>

<p>The sun had scarcely made its appearance above the horizon the
following day when the inmates of the cave were astir.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up everybody,&#8221; shouted Grant, the first to arise.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got work to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yon won&#8217;t have to call me twice,&#8221; exclaimed John,
hastily rising to his feet. &#8220;It seems to me I&#8217;ve been awake
half the night anyway, just waiting for that old sun to come out and
give us enough light to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose it had been a cloudy day and the sun hadn&#8217;t
come out, String,&#8221; said George, who had now joined the others.
&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;d have had to stay in bed all day. My, that
would have been tough luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re pretty funny for so early in the morning,&#8221;
said John shortly. &#8220;After you&#8217;ve broken your back digging
for a couple of hours maybe you won&#8217;t feel quite so
smart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My back will never get tired digging for gold,&#8221; laughed
George. &#8220;I could keep at it for a week and not even feel
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; me too,&#8221; chimed in Sam. &#8220;Ah is pow&#8217;ful
strong when it come to dat kind ob diggin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s get some breakfast and then give all these
strong men a chance,&#8221; laughed Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going swimming first?&#8221; demanded
George.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going, I know that,&#8221; said John
enthusiastically. &#8220;I don&#8217;t intend to miss any swims in the
mornings if I can help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about sharks?&#8221; queried Grant. &#8220;I should think
you&#8217;d have had just about all the swimming you&#8217;d want,
String.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; laughed John. &#8220;I can tell you one
thing, though, and that is that I intend to stick awfully close to
shore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be any closer than I will,&#8221; exclaimed
George seriously. &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave the middle of the ocean to
the fish and not dispute it with them at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s coming?&#8221; called George, who had already
started. It seemed that every one was, for a moment later the other
four members of the little family were close behind George. All were in
excellent spirits and an air of suppressed excitement seemed to pervade
the atmosphere around about them. When any one spoke it was in a tense
tone and every laugh sounded somewhat nervous. Eyes sparkled eagerly
and breath came a trifle faster when the thought of the buried gold
arose in any one&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Diamond horseshoes, Sam!&#8221; exclaimed John, slapping the
grinning negro heartily on the back. &#8220;Diamond horseshoes right
after breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Deed Ah hopes so,&#8221; said Sam. &#8220;Ah sho&#8217;
could use one ob dem.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not here, though,&#8221; laughed Grant. &#8220;Pretty soon we
shan&#8217;t have anything to wear if our clothes get very much more
ragged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Sam,&#8221; said John. &#8220;You
couldn&#8217;t wear your diamond horseshoe on this island.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does yo&#8217; really think dey is any ob dem in dat
chest?&#8221; asked Sam very seriously and very eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt it,&#8221; laughed John. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
they wore such things in the days when this treasure was
buried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s all right dough,&#8221; said Sam cheerfully.
&#8220;As yo&#8217; say Ah wouldn&#8217;t hab no use fo&#8217; one on
dis yere island. All Ah wants am gold enough to buy one when Ah gets
back to Richmon&#8217;. Dat&#8217;s when Ah wants it, an&#8217;, golly,
say won&#8217;t dem niggers be jealous.&#8221; He laughed aloud as he
usually did at the thought, for it was a most pleasing prospect to him.
He was scarcely more than a child in mind; his great, and seemingly his
supreme, desire to make his friends jealous showed this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll find some earrings,&#8221; suggested Fred.
&#8220;We can wear those, and if we find bracelets and gold arm-bands
and anklets and things like that we can put them all on and look like a
bunch of cannibals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve certainly got a great,&#8211;&#8221; George
began sarcastically, when a cry from Grant suddenly interrupted him.
Grant had gained somewhat on the remainder of the band and was down
near the shore when he called.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with him?&#8221; exclaimed John in a
puzzled manner. &#8220;What does he see and what&#8217;s he running
after?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go find out,&#8221; cried Fred eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on everybody! Hurry up!&#8221; called Grant, stopping
for a moment and turning around. Down along the coast he ran, passing
the ledge where they usually went swimming and continuing his course
towards a small crescent-shaped beach only a short distance away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to miss anything,&#8221; exclaimed
George, and he also commenced to run, followed closely by his three
companions.</p>

<p>In a few moments they saw the cause of Grant&#8217;s excitement.
When they reached the spot where they usually bathed they spied him
standing on the shore gazing at an object which lay at his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at that,&#8221; exclaimed George, increasing his
speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a monster,&#8221; echoed Fred.</p>

<p>The remaining distance between them and the object of their
attention was covered in a remarkably short time by the three boys and
their negro companion. Every one was eager to be the first on the
spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of that for a shark?&#8221; demanded Grant
when the others had come to the place where he was standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not a shark, that&#8217;s a gunboat,&#8221;
exclaimed George grimly. &#8220;Where did it come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It washed ashore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; jeered Fred. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t dead, Pop. It
just crawled up on shore for a little nap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think you&#8217;re smart,&#8221; retorted George.
&#8220;I just asked for information.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I gave it to you, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop your fighting, you two,&#8221; exclaimed John.
&#8220;Give some one else a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did it get here?&#8221; said George curiously.
&#8220;What killed it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come around this side and I&#8217;ll show you,&#8221; said
Grant.</p>

<p>All the others went with George and with the giant shark lying on
its side, its white belly towards the waves, Grant pointed out the
cause of its death.</p>

<p>&#8220;There it is,&#8221; he said quietly. A great gaping wound
showed squarely in the center of the shark&#8217;s belly. It must have
been nearly a foot in length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; whistled George. &#8220;Who did that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sam did it,&#8221; said John. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that right,
Sam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah reckon it am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the shark that was after you, String?&#8221;
exclaimed George.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Sam killed him,&#8221; said George unable to fully
understand it all. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how he did it. Why, this
shark must be twenty feet long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; cried Grant, &#8220;and when somebody told you it
was eighteen feet long you laughed. You said it was the biggest fish
story you&#8217;d ever heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I take it back,&#8221; said George simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you suppose he got here?&#8221; exclaimed John, who
was examining with personal interest the mouth of the giant fish. Row
after row of great white teeth, sharp as knives, were seen in the huge
jaw. John shuddered as he remembered how nearly he had come to losing
his life to those wicked weapons.</p>

<p>&#8220;It simply was washed up here by the waves,&#8221; said Grant.
&#8220;It was thrashing around out there at a great rate after Sam and
String had come ashore yesterday. I suppose it finally died and drifted
in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I think Sam was wonderful to dispose of that fellow the
way he did,&#8221; exclaimed George. &#8220;How did you do it,
Sam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With mah ol&#8217; knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You thought he bit the shark to death, I suppose, Pop,&#8221;
laughed Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hot air!&#8221; was George&#8217;s only reply to his remark.
Just what he meant by such a slang expression he probably knew best of
all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s measure the shark,&#8221; exclaimed Grant.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to settle the dispute once and for all and then
when we go home and tell the story, people will have to believe us for
we&#8217;ll all be witnesses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you going to measure?&#8221; inquired Fred.
&#8220;String&#8217;s shoe is up in the cave, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll use String himself instead of his shoe,&#8221;
suggested Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you all take me for?&#8221; demanded John.
&#8220;I&#8217;m no tape measure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How tall are you?&#8221; asked Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Six feet two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In your stocking feet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and my bare feet, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right then,&#8221; laughed Grant. &#8220;Just lie down
alongside the shark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead, String,&#8221; urged Fred. &#8220;It won&#8217;t
hurt you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose not,&#8221; sighed John and he stretched himself at
full length on the beach, the soles of his feet exactly on a line with
the tip of the shark&#8217;s tail. Grant then marked the spot where his
head came and John moved up to this spot and lay down once more. Again
Grant indicated the spot by a mark in the sand and the performance was
repeated. Four times it was necessary to do this before John had
finally covered the entire length of the shark.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s three and one-third times as long as you are,
String,&#8221; announced Grant, when the measurements were
completed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s twenty feet,&#8221; exclaimed George.
&#8220;Say, that&#8217;s a real fish, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think so,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;I&#8217;m also
glad that he is dead and lying on the beach, for I&#8217;m afraid I
couldn&#8217;t enjoy a swim with that fellow hanging around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are others,&#8221; said John.</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t get me where I&#8217;m going in
though,&#8221; laughed Fred. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be so close to shore
that any shark would run aground trying to get at me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s all go in,&#8221; exclaimed Grant.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got work to-day and if we are going swimming
we&#8217;d better hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah mus&#8217; hab one o&#8217; dem teeth,&#8221; said Sam,
referring to the array in the ugly mouth of the great shark.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want one of them for?&#8221; asked George
curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause it am sho&#8217; to bring yo&#8217; luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I want one too,&#8221; cried George. &#8220;I want luck
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get us each one, will you, Sam!&#8221; exclaimed Fred.
&#8220;We can at least wear them for watch fobs when we get
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll help us to find the gold maybe,&#8221;
suggested George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about that,&#8221; exclaimed John,
confidently. &#8220;We&#8217;ll find the gold all right and we
don&#8217;t need any shark teeth or anything else to help us,
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I say we don&#8217;t fool around here any more, but go
and get the gold,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;All we&#8217;ve done so far
is to talk about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later they were all splashing around in the water enjoying
their early morning swim. Soon afterward they returned to the cave,
where they collected everything they had that might aid them in their
search for the buried treasure. They spent but little time there,
however, and then quickly started on their way towards the big black
rock that was so strangely fashioned in the semblance of a shark. Never
did a party start out more eagerly or with higher hopes than this
little band of castaways on their search for buried wealth.</p>

<h2><a id='link_26'></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br /><span class='fss'>THE SPOT
IS MARKED</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got your compass, haven&#8217;t you, Pop?&#8221;
demanded Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right in my hand,&#8221; replied George, holding the precious
article in question up to view.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it work?&#8221; asked Fred, slyly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it works,&#8221; said George loftily.
&#8220;Anything that I have is all right. You ought to know that by
this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we didn&#8217;t have so much work ahead of us this
morning,&#8221; said Fred, &#8220;I should suggest that we stop here
for a minute and take the conceit out of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Pop&#8217;s all right,&#8221; laughed Grant. &#8220;He
just feels good to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you bring your nice gentle little parrot
along, Pop?&#8221; inquired John. &#8220;He&#8217;d have enjoyed seeing
his owner do some work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going to bring him,&#8221; said George, &#8220;but look
what he did to me,&#8221; and he held up a bleeding finger.
&#8220;That&#8217;s his answer to my invitation to come
along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he affectionate?&#8221; laughed John. &#8220;My,
I wish I had a parrot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be all right some day,&#8221; said George
seriously. &#8220;You see if he won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re the trainer and not I,
anyway,&#8221; said John grimly.</p>

<p>Laughing and joking, bantering one another and full of spirits they
soon came to their destination, and prepared to measure off the
distances according to the code.</p>

<p>&#8220;Read what the code says first of all, Grant,&#8221; exclaimed
Fred. &#8220;That&#8217;ll help us all to know just what we are to
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to know it by heart now I should think,&#8221;
laughed Grant. &#8220;Still, I&#8217;ll read it if you say
so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead, Grant,&#8221; urged John, and once more they
listened to the words that meant so much to every one of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a course due north one hundred feet from the southern
extremity of shark rock, then east fifty feet and north by east
thirty-three. Dig.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dig,&#8221; cried George. &#8220;That&#8217;s the important
word. Dig! Dig! Dig!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, Pop,&#8221; exclaimed Grant.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to find the place where we are to dig first, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said George eagerly. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
the compass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lay it flat out on the rock,&#8221; directed Grant.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll take our first observation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little instrument was placed on top of the great rock while the
five gold seekers crowded around it eagerly. The delicate indicator
fluttered excitedly for some moments, then its fluctuations gradually
became less and less. At last it stopped entirely, the tiny needle
pointing exactly north.</p>

<p>&#8220;There we are,&#8221; exclaimed George. &#8220;Now if we go
directly opposite to the way that needle is pointing we&#8217;ll find
the southern extremity of this rock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we want,&#8221; cried Grant. &#8220;You
walk down there, Fred.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fred hastened to obey and soon stationed himself at the opposite end
of the rock, which happened to be the tail of the shark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get in direct line now,&#8221; directed Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to tell me what that is,&#8221; replied
Fred. &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell the exact spot, you know, from looking
at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed John, &#8220;and we
don&#8217;t want to make any mistake at the very beginning of our
calculations. That would throw us &#8217;way off later on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take this stick,&#8221; suggested George, bringing up a long
thin shoot he had torn from one of the nearby bushes. &#8220;Lay it
flat out on the rock and in a direct line with the needle. Be sure to
get it exact and if we do we can easily enough find the &#8216;southern
extremity.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>This was quickly done, and in a few moments the exact spot desired
was located beyond the shadow of a doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; exclaimed Grant, &#8220;the next thing to do is
to measure off a distance due north from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your tape measure,&#8221; laughed John, offering
his shoe to Grant. &#8220;That&#8217;s exactly ten inches long.
I&#8217;ll take my oath to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see,&#8221; mused Grant. &#8220;We want to
measure a hundred feet from here and the shoe is ten inches long. How
are we going to figure that out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy enough,&#8221; exclaimed John. &#8220;You
do it this way: there are twelve inches in a foot, of course, and in
one hundred feet there would be one hundred times twelve, or twelve
hundred. Now the shoe is ten inches long, so you divide twelve hundred
by ten, which is&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One hundred and twenty,&#8221; said Grant quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; exclaimed John. &#8220;In other words, we want
to measure a distance one hundred and twenty times the length of my
shoe due north from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead and do it,&#8221; urged George. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do
it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see to it that we keep going straight north,&#8221;
advised Grant. &#8220;That is one of the most important things of
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That suits me,&#8221; said George. &#8220;Start your
measurements.&#8221;</p>

<p>The course led off across the sandy beach towards a little clump of
pine trees. Placing the toe of John&#8217;s shoe close up against the
spot on shark&#8217;s rock that was their starting place, Grant began
to measure. With a small stick he marked the place to which the heel of
the shoe extended and then repeated the operation, using the marker for
a starting-point. George kept close watch with his compass to see that
the correct direction was being followed.</p>

<p>It was slow work and arduous. Everybody was on his hands and knees
keeping careful watch of all the operations. The sun was hot and in
some places sharp stones or bits of coral were mixed in with the sand
so that more than one of the little party soon had bleeding knees and
hands as a result. No one seemed to mind or even to notice these
discomforts, however. The task they were engaged in was so interesting
and absorbing to them that they paid scant attention to anything
else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be sure to keep track of the number of times we have
measured, Fred,&#8221; reminded Grant. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want any
slip-up, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about that,&#8221; said Fred confidently.
&#8220;Every time you shift that shoe I make a mark on this page from
George&#8217;s diary. When there are five marks made I cross them
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many so far?&#8221; inquired John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seventy,&#8221; replied Fred after a rapid calculation.
&#8220;Fifty more to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hurry,&#8221; warned Grant. &#8220;We want it
right, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We certainly do,&#8221; agreed George. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
want to do all this work for nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The measurements were continued, painfully and slowly. Every ten
inches was marked off with the greatest of care, and if John&#8217;s
statement that his shoe was exactly ten inches long was correct it
seemed impossible that any mistake had crept into their calculations.
John insisted over and over again that the length quoted was absolutely
correct, but his friends kept on asking him, so anxious were they to be
perfectly sure.</p>

<p>&#8220;One hundred and twenty,&#8221; announced Fred at length.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the end of the first journey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank goodness,&#8221; exclaimed Grant, wiping the
perspiration from his brow. &#8220;That&#8217;s about as hard work as I
care to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say it is,&#8221; agreed George. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
rest for a few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;I&#8217;ll never
last otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mark the exact spot where we are to start on the next
lap,&#8221; said John, &#8220;and then let&#8217;s go up here in the
shade and rest for a little while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;I&#8217;ll put this
stick in the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>The important spot plainly indicated, the whole party withdrew to
the shade afforded by a neighboring clump of palms and stretched
themselves upon the ground for a well earned rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose we have any business to be working out
in that sun in the middle of the day anyway,&#8221; said Grant.
&#8220;It&#8217;s entirely too hot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think we&#8217;re apt to get a sunstroke?&#8221;
queried John.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good chance of it, I should think. I
don&#8217;t believe that people who are used to living in the tropics
would be working out in it either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suttinly dey wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Sam with great
conviction. &#8220;It am bery, bery dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so too,&#8221; exclaimed George. &#8220;I say we
don&#8217;t do anything more until the sun begins to go down a little.
We&#8217;ve got more than half of it measured out anyway, and it
won&#8217;t take us so very long to do the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The only trouble is,&#8221; remarked Fred, &#8220;that if we
wait until then to finish the measuring we won&#8217;t be able to do
any digging to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of it?&#8221; demanded Grant. &#8220;Gold won&#8217;t
evaporate, you know, and if it&#8217;s there to-day it&#8217;ll be
there just as much to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Grant,&#8221; agreed George.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no hurry, and much as I want to see that gold,
I&#8217;m willing to wait &#8217;till to-morrow rather than run the risk of
sunstroke or something.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having reached this decision they lay about in the shade all through
the tropical noon and discussed the treasure for the thousandth time
since they first had come into possession of the code. Sometimes they
dozed and Sam, true to the traditions of his race, slept soundly.</p>

<p>At last the shadows began to lengthen and a cool breeze sprang up
off the water. It was like food to a starving man it was so refreshing
and strengthening.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re off!&#8221; cried Grant, springing eagerly to his
feet.</p>

<p>Every one joined him quickly and the task was resumed, and the air
being cooler now, they all worked better and more easily.</p>

<p>&#8220;This next course is just half as long as the last one,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said John, &#8220;that makes just sixty times the
length of my shoe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Due east they measured off the distance and before very long had
marked the completion of the second stage of their journey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; exclaimed Grant, &#8220;we go north by east
thirty-three feet. How many lengths of your shoe is that,
John?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You figure it out, Fred,&#8221; urged John.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got pencil and paper and all you have to do, you
know, is to multiply thirty-three by twelve and divide by
ten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirty-nine and six-tenths times,&#8221; announced Fred.
&#8220;How can we measure that fraction exactly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t need to,&#8221; said Grant. &#8220;It&#8217;s
the last figure and we can get it within a couple of inches.
We&#8217;ll dig a hole a couple of feet square all around our last
marker, so two or three inches won&#8217;t make any
difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed Fred, and the measurements
were continued.</p>

<p>Soon they came to the end, but there an unexpected complication
presented itself. Thirty-three feet from the last point brought them
squarely up against a palm tree some twelve or fifteen inches in
diameter.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the end,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;How can
we dig down through a tree like that though? We must have made a
mistake in our calculations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why so?&#8221; demanded George.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how it could be any other way,&#8221;
insisted Fred. &#8220;In the first place how can any one bury anything
underneath a tree like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said George. &#8220;They buried the
treasure here and then planted this palm tree to mark the spot. Do you
notice that it is the only one within fifty or a hundred feet of
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Pop,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;I
believe that that&#8217;s exactly what happened.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h2><a id='link_27'></a>CHAPTER XXVII<br /><span
class='fss'>CONCLUSION</span></h2>

<p>After a sleepless and restless night the excited little party of
treasure seekers repaired once more to the palm tree which marked the
spot so long sought by them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got your knife, Sam?&#8221; exclaimed Grant.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s see how good a lumberman you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&#8217;ll hab dat ol&#8217; tree down in no time,&#8221;
cried Sam confidently, and with his great heavy knife grasped firmly in
his right hand he fiercely attacked the unsuspecting tree. The wood was
soft and before long began to yield to Sam&#8217;s blows.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll just about finish up that knife,&#8221;
remarked Grant to Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose it does,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;There&#8217;s
another hoop from that old cask up at the cave and he can easily make
another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t a barrel of gold worth more than an old iron
knife anyway?&#8221; said John. &#8220;I should say so if you asked
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A barrel of gold wouldn&#8217;t have done you much good when
that shark was after you though,&#8221; said Grant grimly. &#8220;I
guess just at that time Sam&#8217;s old iron knife was worth more to
you than anything in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; acknowledged John soberly. &#8220;I
have no right to talk against that knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come over here and give this tree a push,&#8221; shouted
George who was bustling importantly around Sam. &#8220;You fellows seem
to think this is a party or something. Come over here and do some
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>No great amount of urging was required, however, and a moment later
every one in the party was standing about the tree, pushing and pulling
with all his might.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s beginning to give!&#8221; exclaimed George.
&#8220;Keep it up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let Sam get to work for a minute or so more,&#8221; suggested
Grant. &#8220;About a dozen more good blows will finish the
job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed Sam readily. &#8220;Lemme at
dat ol&#8217; tree agin.&#8221;</p>

<p>As though it was his mortal enemy Sam attacked the unsuspecting palm
tree and dealt it such fierce blows that it soon required only a slight
exercise of strength to topple it over.</p>

<p>&#8220;There she is,&#8221; panted George when the tree lay
prostrate. &#8220;She&#8217;s down and now the only thing that stands
between us and the treasure is a few feet or yards of sand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope it&#8217;s feet,&#8221; said John.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that there are no rocks to go through either,&#8221;
added Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly can think of more hard luck than any one I ever
saw, Fred,&#8221; exclaimed George, pretending to be very much
discouraged with his friend. &#8220;Why do you always look on the dark
side of things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t. I just believe in being sensible about it,
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me you&#8217;re always looking for
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; said John, &#8220;you didn&#8217;t get
those shark teeth, did you, Sam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Deed Ah didn&#8217;t,&#8221; exclaimed Sam, resting a moment
from his exertions, for he had already commenced to dig. &#8220;Ah done
clean forgot &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will that bring us hard luck?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said George. &#8220;Sam said that one
would bring you good luck if you had it, but he didn&#8217;t say it
would be hard luck without it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; said John, &#8220;but I thought that
perhaps if you had a chance to get one and didn&#8217;t do it you might
give yourself bad luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re as bad as Fred,&#8221; exclaimed George
disgustedly. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t you all be cheerful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t you all go to work is what I&#8217;d like to
know?&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;It seems to me that that is more
important than luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Grant,&#8221; said George readily.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no such thing as luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s such a thing as work, though,&#8221; said Grant
grimly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s all do some of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They fell to work with a will and dug busily and steadily for a long
time. A hole about four feet square was started and the boys were armed
with almost everything one could think of in place of real tools.
Sticks, flat pieces of rock, and hands almost more than anything else
were employed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing for us we are digging in sand and not
in clay,&#8221; remarked Fred after some time had elapsed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say it is!&#8221; agreed John. &#8220;As it is, we
aren&#8217;t making a great deal of headway it seems to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, we are,&#8221; exclaimed Grant. &#8220;The hole is
at least a couple of feet deep already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we could all get in there at once,&#8221; said George.
&#8220;We could work much faster then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps we won&#8217;t have to go much deeper,&#8221; said
Grant hopefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we shall though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose we take turns down there with the knife,&#8221;
suggested Fred. &#8220;One of us can loosen up the sand with it and
then a couple more can get in and throw it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good scheme,&#8221; exclaimed John.
&#8220;Give me the knife, Sam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah can do it mahself,&#8221; protested Sam.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t either,&#8221; laughed John.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve done enough work for to-day anyway. Let me have it
now and perhaps you can take another turn at it later.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reluctantly Sam gave up the knife and joined the others who stood
and watched John down in the hole. When he had loosened a considerable
amount of earth he climbed up and Fred and George took his place and
threw the loose sand out of the pit. This operation was repeated many
times with different ones doing the work. In this way the labor was
lightened and the hole grew amazingly.</p>

<p>It was George&#8217;s turn with the knife and he was working
tremendously. He hacked and carved the sand, exerting himself to the
utmost. All at once the knife struck something hard that had a metallic
ring to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got it, Pop!&#8221; cried Grant excitedly.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got it sure!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry up and dig around it,&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;Let
me do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do it all right,&#8221; said George, and he fell to
work with even more zeal than formerly.</p>

<p>Again and again his knife struck the metallic surface beneath him.
His companions, grouped all around the pit, riveted their gaze on him
and watched him with rapt attention. George dropped the knife and dug
the sand away with his hands. The black top of an iron chest presented
itself to the view of the fascinated onlookers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you move it, Pop?&#8221; cried Grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t find the edge of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah get &#8217;im,&#8221; said Sam suddenly, and he dropped
into the pit and began to work like a beaver. Their combined efforts
soon cleared all the sand from the top of the chest, which appeared to
be about eighteen inches square. On the top was a little handle with
which to lift it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lift it out, Sam!&#8221; cried John. &#8220;Lift it
out!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sam exerted all his strength but could not budge the stocky little
chest. It was either extremely heavy or stuck fast. Every one who was
concerned in the matter was so interested in these operations that he
was entirely unconscious of everything except what was going on in the
pit right before their eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dig it out a little more,&#8221; advised Grant. &#8220;You
can lift it then.&#8221;</p>

<p>This proved to be true and a few moments later after a great pulling
and tugging Sam succeeded in raising the heavy little chest from its
place. Another great effort and he swung it up out of the pit where it
was pounced upon by Fred, John and Grant. Sam and George followed
almost instantly and an immediate inspection was made to see how it was
to be opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no lock on&#8211;&#8221; began Grant eagerly,
when he was strangely interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahoy, there!&#8221; came a shout and in amazement every one
turned to see whence came the hail. Its bow just grating on the beach,
was a small boat manned by four sailors; a half-mile off shore a large
steamer was riding at anchor. So engrossed had all the boys been in
digging the pit that they had not once noticed nor suspected its
approach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; gasped John, &#8220;what do you think of
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means we get home all right anyway,&#8221; exclaimed Fred.
&#8220;Where do you suppose it came from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t even care,&#8221; said George. &#8220;How about
the treasure, Grant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The chest is empty,&#8221; replied Grant gazing ruefully into
the barren depths of the stout little iron box.</p>
